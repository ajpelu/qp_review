AB Mixed oak-beech forests are particularly valuable from an ecological and socioeconomic perspective but are increasingly exposed to anthropogenic impacts. We wonder whether anthropogenic change drivers, such as increased drought and ungulate populations affect optimal regeneration niches, species coexistence, and mixed-species forest dynamics. We compared understorey composition, structure and distribution with the overstorey counterpart in an oak-beech forest located at its southernmost European distribution (Central Spain) with increasing drought and ungulate herbivory for the last decades.
   Results showed that Ilex aquifolium and Prunus avium had greater representation in the recruitment layer as compared to the understorey layer whereas, for the dominant Quercus spp. and Fagus sylvatica, there was a tendency suggesting an expansion of Fagus at the expense of Quercus. Density of tree recruits showed strong differences across microsites. The greatest density was found under tree and under shrub cover whereas the lowest was found under woody debris. By species, Quercus regenerated better in open and shrub microsites whereas Fagus and flex regeneration was higher under tree cover. Large patches of shrub cover favoured Prunus avium recruitment, particularly against ungulate herbivory as it was the most heavily browsed species, followed by Quercus, Ilex and Fagus in a descending order. Herbivory occurrence and intensity on tree recruits strongly varied with the microsite, with greater herbivory levels in open microsites. Woody debris on the ground only protected tree recruits from browsing when they were located under tree cover.
   Overall, fenced areas with no ungulates showed greater tree species coexistence (28% increase in species richness) and recruitment abundance (81% increase) after 7 years of exclusion. We also found a large increase in tree recruit growth and height:diameter ratio (h:d) for all studied species when fenced. Fagus and Prunus avium showed the greatest growth and h:d increase, much greater than those of Quercus and flex. The h:d was identified as a reliable indicator of ungulate herbivory and reference values (under null levels of ungulate herbivory) were provided for each species.
   We conclude that there is an imperative need for adaptive management strategies that address the joint effects of climate change (e.g. increased drought) and ungulate herbivory in mixed oak-beech forests. The provision of different microsites, including patches of shrub cover in open microsites and woody debris under dense tree cover, will facilitate the availability of suitable regeneration niches for most species and will therefore promote future species coexistence.

AB Key message In recent decades, there has been a decline in growth in a rear-edge broadleaf forest ofFagus sylvatica,Quercus petraea, and Quercus pyrenaica. Although temperatures have been rising due to climate change, the observed decline in growth was mainly attributed to increased density and competition between trees since the cessation of traditional uses such as logging in the 1960s. Context In recent decades, two major factors have influenced tree growth in many forests: climate warming, which is associated with aridification and negative growth trends in many Mediterranean forests, and abandonment of forest management, resulting from forest policy in conjunction with rural depopulation in Europe, often leading to an increase in competition and a decrease in growth. Aims Here, we study the growth trends in a mixed forest ofFagus sylvatica,Quercus petraea, andQuercus pyrenaica, where the abandonment of traditional uses in the 1960s has been followed by an increase in tree density. In this forest, bothF. sylvaticaandQ. petraeareach their south-westernmost limits of distribution. Methods Using dendrochronological methods and growth modeling, we assess the importance of climate warming on the shifts in competitive growth advantage of these three coexisting tree species and the relative importance of climate and competition on growth trends. Results Q. petraeaand especiallyF. sylvaticashowed a favorable evolution of their competitive capacity, despite the increase in temperatures that has occurred in the area in recent decades.F. sylvaticapresented the lowest sensitivity to climate. Conclusion Under the current climate and forest structure conditions, competition is the most limiting factor on tree growth for the two oak species.

AB In northern Mediterranean forests, increasing drought stress due to the on-going climate change is combined with stand ageing due to the lack of management. Management by thinning may alleviate drought stress by reducing competition, but its application is challenging in coppices of resprouting species where its long-term consequences for tree demography and stand dynamics are difficult to evaluate. In this study, we investigate the long-term (15 years) demographic responses of holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) to a combination of thinning from below (- 30% basal area) and experimental rainfall exclusion (- 27% precipitation). Stem growth, survival and resistance to an extreme drought event were positively linked to both stem size and local competition release after thinning. Thinning improvement of growth and survival were thus due to both a selection of the biggest, most vigorous, trees and to a release of competition for water. Rainfall exclusion, on the other hand, led to a shift of the tree size-mortality relationship, which resulted in the death of bigger trees, in a faster loss of stool density and in a slower evolution of the stand basal area compared to the control. Thinning was beneficial by cancelling the rainfall exclusion effects on growth and mortality, and by doubling the stand basal area increment compared to unthinned control. The initial loss of stools due to thinning was compensated by a lower mortality, suggesting that thinning do not reduce further the amount of unique genotypes on the long-term. Positive thinning effects on stem growth decreased over time but remained significant 15 years after thinning, while resprouting dynamics strongly decreased with time. These results indicate that moderate thinning from below is a relevant strategy to increase stem vitality and stand production in old coppices, particularly in a context of a chronic rise in drought stress and more frequent extreme drought episodes.

AB Global change challenges ecosystems in xeric locations transformed by intensive human use. Resilience to drought of relict MediterraneanQuercus pyrenaicapopulations in the southern Iberian Peninsula was analyzed in relation to historical records of land use, combining dendroecological growth of adult trees and greenness (EVI) as proxies for secondary and primary growth. The growth trends reflected a strong influence of old land-use legacies (firewood removal) in the current forest structure. Trees were highly sensitive to moisture availability, but both primary growth and secondary growth expressed high resilience to drought events over the short and the long term. Resilience and the tree growth response to climate followed a water-stress gradient. A positive growth trend since the late 1970s was particularly evident in mesic (colder and wetter) high-elevation stands, but absent in the most xeric (warmer and drier) stands. The high values of resilience observed suggest that the studiedQ. pyrenaicapopulations are located in a geographical but not a climatic or ecological rear edge. Resilience of oak stands to drought events was not spatially homogeneous across the mountain range, due to differences in ecological conditions and/or past management legacies. This is particularly relevant for rear-edge populations where topographic and biophysical variability can facilitate the existence of refugia.

AB Questions Tree diversity is key to the functioning of forest ecosystems. However, which components of tree diversity are responsible for tree diversity effects on associated organisms, and in which context, is poorly understood. Location ORPHEE Experimental site, Cestas-Pierroton in the southwest of France. Methods We used a large-scale tree diversity experiment in which we controlled water availability by an irrigation treatment to address tree diversity and water stress effects on the diversity and height of forest understorey vegetation. We assessed the species richness and height of understorey vegetation in irrigated and non-irrigated 20 m x 20 m plots, either being monocultures ofPinus pinaster,Betula pendulaorQuercus robur, or either mixtures of two to five species amongPinus pinaster,Betula pendula,Quercus robur,Quercus ilexandQuercus pyrenaica. Results Tree species composition, i.e. the proportion of birch or pine, had a significant effect on understorey plant assemblage, species richness and diversity. The proportion of the fast-growing deciduous angiospermBetula pendulawas negatively correlated to understorey plant richness and diversity, and positively correlated with understorey vegetation height. Understorey vegetation was higher in irrigated plots than in non-irrigated plots, but irrigation had no clear effect on the species richness, diversity or composition of understorey plant assemblages. Conclusions Forest tree species composition and in particular the relative proportions of different tree species had stronger effects on understorey plants than tree species richness per se. These effects were consistent across irrigation treatments. Even in young forest plantations, effects of tree mixture on understorey vegetation may be observed and seem mainly driven by the functional type of tree in the canopy and initial dynamics of plant regeneration in planted forests.

AB Land abandonment followed by natural revegetation constitutes the main land-use change in the Mediterranean mountains, affecting soil quality and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks; however, there are few studies analysing the effects of cropland abandonment on soils in mid-mountains. In the Leza Valley (Spain), 43.2% of the area was cultivated but abandoned during the 20th-century. Natural revegetation gave rise to five land uses (LULCs): pastures (5 years), shrubs (Cistus laurifolius, 20-35 years), bushes (Juniperus communis, 35-50 years), young forests (Quercus pyrenaica) and old forests (>70 years). The aim of this research was to study the effects of natural revegetation of abandoned fields on physico-chemical soil quality and SOC in various LULCs. In each of the LULCs, soil samples were collected every 10 cm, down to 40 cm depth, at three points, with a total of 60 samples being analysed (12 per LULC). In addition, plant species inventories were carried out. The results indicated (a) significant differences in physico-chemical soil quality between the first years of abandonment and forests; (b) the SOC content increased with revegetation duration and decreased with increase in soil depth; (c) the highest SOC and TN stocks were found in the first 10 cm; (d) the results of the principal component analysis with all the data differentiate forests from shrubs and pastures. This study confirms the need to be aware of the effects of land abandonment and natural revegetation processes on the soil, in order to promote management strategies to preserve ecosystem services that agricultural marginal lands can provide.

AB Tree species have good tolerance to a range of environmental conditions, though their ability to respond and persist to environmental changes is dramatically reduced at the rear-edge distribution limits. At those edges, gene flow conferring adaptation is impaired due to lack of populations at lower latitudes. Thus, trees mainly rely on phenotypic changes to buffer against long-term environmental changes. Interspecific hybridization may offer an alternative mechanism in the generation of novel genetic recombinants that could be particularly valuable to ensure persistence in geographically isolated forests. In this paper, we take advantage of the longevity of a temperate-submediterranean mixed-oak forest to explore the long-term impact of environmental changes on two different oak species and their hybrid. Individual trees were genetically characterized and classified into three groups: pureQuercus petraea(Matt.), Liebl, pureQ. pyrenaicaWilld, and hybrids. We calculated basal area increment and intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) from tree-ring width and delta C-13 per genetic group, respectively. Tree-growth drivers were assessed using correlation analyses and generalized linear mixed models for two contrasting climatic periods: (1880-1915, colder with [CO2] < 303 ppm; and 1980-2015, warmer with [CO2] > 338 ppm). The three genetic groups have increased radial growth and iWUE during the last decades, being the least drought-tolerant QuPe the most sensitive species to water stress. However, no significant differences were found among genetic groups neither in mean growth rate nor in mean iWUE. Furthermore, little differences were found in the response to climate among groups. Genetic groups only differed in the relationship between delta C-13 and temperature and precipitation during the earlier period, but such a difference disappeared during the recent decades. Climate change may have promoted species-level convergence as a response to environment-induced growth limitations, which translated in synchronized growth and response to climate as well as a tighter stomatal control and increased iWUE across coexisting oak species.

AB Natural forests are considered a reservoir of great biological diversity constituting one of the most important ecosystems in Europe.Quercusstudy is essential to assess ecological conservation of forests, and also of economic importance for different industries. In addition, oak pollen can cause high sensitization rates of respiratory allergies in pollen-allergy sufferers. This study sought to know the pollen production of six oak species in the transitional area between the Eurosiberian and Mediterranean Bioclimatic Regions, and to assess the impact of climate change on airborne oak pollen concentrations. The study was conducted in Ourense (NW Spain) over the 1993-2019 period. A Lanzoni VPPS 2000 volumetric trap monitored airborne pollen. A pollen production study was carried out in ten trees randomly selected in severalQuercusforest around the Ourense city. Oak pollen represented around 14% of annual total pollen registered in the atmosphere of Ourense, showing an increasing trend during the last decade. Pollen production of the six studied oak species follow the proportions 1:1:2:5:90:276 forQ. ilex,Q. faginea,Q. rubra,Q. suber,Q. pyrenaica,andQ. roburrespectively. We detected a significant trend to the increase of the annual maximum temperature, whereas a decrease of the maximum and mean temperatures during three previous months to oak flowering. This could be related with the detected trend to a delay of the oak Main Pollen Season onset of 0.47 days per year. We also found significant trends to an increase of the annual pollen integral of 7.9% pollen grains per year, and the pollen peak concentration of 7.5% pollen grains per year.Quercusairborne pollen monitoring as well as the knowledge of the reproductive behavior of the main oak species, bring us an important support tool offering a promising bio-indicator to detect ecological variations induced by climate change.

AB The Spanish Central Range hosts some of the southernmost populations of Fagus sylvatica L. (European beech). Recent cartography indicates that these populations are expanding, going up-streams and gaining ground to oak forests of Quercus pyrenaica Willd., heather-lands, and pine plantations. Understanding the spectral phenology of European beech populations-which leaf flush occurs earlier than other vegetation formations-in this Mediterranean mountain range will provide insights of the species recent dynamics, and will enable modelling its performance under future climate oscillations. Intra-annual series of 211 Landsat OLI/ETM+ images, acquired between April 2013-December 2019, and 217 Sentinel-2A/B images, acquired between April 2017-December 2019, were employed to characterize the spectral phenology of European beech populations and five other vegetation types for comparison in an area of 108000 ha. Vegetation indices (VI) including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Tasseled Cap Angle (TCA) from Landsat, and the NDVI and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from Sentinel-2 were retrieved from sample pixels. The temporal series of these VI were modelled with Savitzky-Golay and double logistic functions, and assessed with TIMESAT software, enabling the parametric characterization of European beech spectral phenology in the area with the start, length, and end of season, as well as peak time and value. The length of beech phenological season was similar when portrayed by Landsat and Sentinel-2 NDVI time series (214 and 211 days on average for the common period 2017-2019) although start and end differed. Compared with NDVI counterparts the TCA season started and peaked later, and the EVI season was shorter. Sentinel-2 NDVI peaked higher than Landsat NDVI. The European beech had an earlier (21 days on average) start of season than competing oak forests. Joint analysis of data from the virtual constellation Landsat/Sentinel-2 and calibration with field observations may enable more detailed knowledge of phenological traits at the landscape scale.

AB Tree health declines can be caused by interactions between pests and pathogens and many studies have shown a reduction in their damage in mixed species forests compared to monocultures. Yet few authors have considered tree diversity effects on both groups simultaneously. Moreover, it is unclear whether diversity effects on tree pests and pathogens are robust to changes in abiotic conditions, such as drought.
   We addressed tree diversity effects on foliar insect herbivory, oak powdery mildew and their interaction under contrasting water regimes in a large-scale tree diversity experiment in SW France. Using an irrigation treatment that alleviated drought conditions, we were able to experimentally assess the effects of tree diversity under contrasting abiotic environments. We surveyed plots along a richness gradient from one to four tree species, in which a focal study species of oak (Quercus robur) was mixed with other oak species (Q. pyrenaica and Q. ilex) and a taller, broadleaved species (Betula pendula).
   Increasing tree species richness lowered leaf miner abundance, leaf chewer damage and oak powdery mildew infection, consistent with a protective effect of resource dilution. However, richness effects on leaf miners were stronger in irrigated compared to non-irrigated blocks, indicating that environmental conditions can modulate diversity effects. Separate from the effect of tree species richness, the presence of birch in a plot increased damage by leaf chewers and powdery mildew, but lowered leaf miner damage, suggesting additional tree neighbour identity effects potentially linked to modulation of microclimate. We found a negative association between leaf miner abundance and oak powdery mildew, consistent with antagonism between oak damage agents.
   Synthesis. Overall, our study illustrates the importance of considering both tree diversity and composition (neighbour identity) in designing forests more resistant to pest and pathogen damage.

AB Key message An in-depth characterization of the forests of 10 dominant species by stand variables at national scale showed, that overall, stands growing in the southernmost regions of Spain display low regeneration. Otherwise, the relationships between stand variables and geographic location are species dependent. Similarly, the degree of inter and interregional variability varies strongly among species. Context The regions of provenance can potentially be used as units with uniform ecological, phenotypic, and genetic traits to characterize forests. Aims Our objective was to characterize forests through stand variables at national scale for the 10 most widespread dominant tree species in Spain (five Pinaceae and five Fagaceae species) using the regions of provenance as ecologically homogeneous areas. Methods We used the National Forest Inventory as the dataset and multivariate analyses of variance with a bootstrapping and principal coordinates analysis for the statistical evaluation. Results Overall, the mean diameter of adult trees was negatively related to recruitment variables, and the mean height of adult trees was negatively related to shrub coverage and number of shrub species. The statistical analyses revealed significant differences between regions of provenance for all variables. The regions of provenance where Pinus sylvestris, P. nigra, P. pinea, Quercus suber, and Q. ilex are dominant, displayed a large variability among regions. In contrast, the regions of provenance for P. halepensis, Q. pyrenaica, and Q. faginea displayed a small low inter-regional variability. Conclusion Forest management as well as climate conditions shaped deeply forests, which lead to differences on stand variables among provenances by species. Stands growing on the southernmost locations, overall, are more prone to the forecasted climate change due to the low rates of regeneration.

AB The micromorphological characters of leaves in the genus Quercus have proved very useful in their taxonomy. A microhistological study of the most representative species of the genus Quercus in the eastern part of Sierra Morena (southern Iberian Peninsula) is carried out in this work: Q. coccifera, Q. faginea subsp. faginea, Q. pyrenaica, Q. rotundifolia and Q. suber. The leaves microcharacters were studied, measured, photographed and compared in order to provide a good description by optical microscope. In particular, features related to trichomes, stomata and epidermal cells on adaxial and abaxial leaf surface have been used. The data for 21 variables were collected. Our study confirms the usefulness of the micromorphological characters of the leaf epidermis and optical microscopy to distinguish between Quercus species, and has helped to identify the studied species. Some of the species can be identified by a single diagnostic character, and others by a combination of few characters. Based on the set of analyzed characteristics, a dichotomy key for the differentiation of the five taxa studied in this work is proposed.

AB In light of concerns over climate change and increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, it is of importance to investigate soil organic matter in Mediterranean forests at a profile scale. In-depth studies of the organic fraction are also of interest to improve understanding of carbon balance and to facilitate modelling of carbon fixation in forest soils. This research evaluates the relationships between diverse parameters such as colour, content, and form of soil organic matter (SOM). Two Quercus pyrenica ecosystems with soils classified as inceptisols with a xeric or dry moisture regime, and developed under a Mediterranean climate in Spain, were used to characterize SOM through the complete sequence of layers of the soil profile. The differentiating factor between the two ecosystems was slope gradient. Characterization was done using characteristics of humic substances (HS) as indicators of SOM turnover in inceptisols. Infrared analysis was used to further characterize the humic acids. As soil colour measurements are a tool for soil type classification and soil organic carbon prediction, the relation between HS colour measured by reflection and by transmission was determined in order to establish a relationship between measurement techniques. Infrared analysis and colour provided evidence of a different level of stabilization of HS from both soils, and between the different horizons. Oxidation of humic acids was found to be greater in deeper horizons than in the surface layers. An inverse relationship between HS colour measured by reflection and by transmission was revealed. Both soils showed a clear trend in which horizons presenting lower absorbance numbers showed higher figures of hue and value. A more marked accumulation of humified compounds was found in pedons, (the smallest unit or volume of soil that contains all the soil types), in the less steep slope. This might be explained in terms of the physiographic position affecting infiltration behavior and exposure to runoff.

AB Wood is one of the most highly valued materials in enology since the chemical composition and sensorial properties of wine change significantly when in contact with it. The need for wood in cooperage and the concern of enologists in their search for new materials to endow their wines with a special personality has generated interest in the use of other Quercus genus materials different from the traditional ones (Q. petraea, Q. robur and Q. alba) and even other wood genera. Thereby, species from same genera such as Q. pyrenaica Willd., Q. faginea Lam., Q. humboldtti Bonpl., Q. oocarpa Liebm., Q. stellata Wangenh, Q. frainetto Ten., Q. lyrata Walt., Q. bicolor Willd. and other genera such as Castanea sativa Mill. (chestnut), Robinia pseudoacacia L. (false acacia), Prunus avium L. and P.cereaus L. (cherry), Fraxinus excelsior L. (European ash) and F. americana L. (American ash) have been studied with the aim of discovering whether they could be a new reservoir of wood for cooperage. This review aims to summarize the characterization of tannin and low molecular weight phenol compositions of these alternative woods for enology in their different cooperage stages and compare them to traditional oak woods, as both are essential to proposing their use in cooperage for aging wine.

AB We studied the relation between xylem and leaf phenology, and how environmental factors can modify the growth rhythm of Quercus pyrenaica Willd. on the boundary of its northwestern distribution.
   For this, wood formation and leaf phenology were monitored in 2012 and 2013 at five sites along an altitudinal gradient. Ten trees were randomly sampled at each site every 10-12 days, their leaf phenological stage recorded, and a microcore extracted to study cambial activities. These events were related to each other, as well as to air temperature for 10-60 day running periods along the year, in order to identify the association between processes, and the most relevant time windows for the onset and cessation of tree growth.
   The first earlywood vessels began their expansion before budburst, and leaf unfolding occurred when at least the first row of earlywood vessels had undergone maturation. However, the temperature regime did not explain the beginning of cell maturation, whereas the cessation of cell enlargement was delayed by maximum temperature, and to a greater extent by thermal amplitude provided that water is available.
   Primary and secondary growth of Q. pyrenaica were clearly synchronized at all sites, confirming that the maturation of the first earlywood vessels is essential for crown development. This strong synchronicity suggests that temperature is not the main factor for the beginning of primary and secondary growth; on the contrary, the cessation of wood formation appears to be more dependent on temperature, though also modulated by precipitation.

AB Hoverflies are frequently used as biodiversity indicators and are targets of ecological studies across Europe. How hoverfly diversity responds to ecological variables is essential for species and habitat conservation. The present study is a first attempt to assess the hoverfly diversity of deciduous woodlands of Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) in La Vera (Central-Western Spain), a habitat in need of conservation and a region that is poorly known in terms of hoverflies. Hoverflies were sampled with hand net in a mature-woodland site, a young-woodland site, and two close-by grassland sites. A higher number of species and individuals was recorded in woodland sites than in grassland sites, with only two species exclusive to the grasslands and thus, suggesting that woodland sites might be acting as a hoverfly reservoir and source. The proportion of species with phytophagous and saprophagous larvae in woodland sites was higher than outside the woodlands, probably due to a higher availability of resources in woodland sites for phytophagous and saprophagous species. The mature woodland was found to have a higher number of species and individuals than the young woodland, possibly due to the presence of grassy clearings and rotting materials in the trees of the mature woodland. The highest number of species was found in the predatory guild (Syrphinae), and smaller-bodied species within this guild were found to be more frequent in grassland than in woodland sites; possible explanations for this result are discussed. Further investigation is required to confirm and expand the results and conclusions found in this initial study on the hoverfly community of the poorly studied Q. pyrenaica woodlands of Central-Western Spain.

AB Seasoning and toasting treatments carried out in cooperage influence the chemical composition of the oak, and these treatments affect different oak species in different ways. For this reason, numerous studies have focused on the evaluation of both the oak wood materials and the resulting aged wines in order to optimize the different cooperage processes. Seasoning involves immobilizing the wood for long periods of time, leading to an increase in the price of the final product. When using alternative products instead of barrels, in addition to the seasoning and toasting of the wood, the size of the wood pieces is a determining factor in the characteristics of the final wine. Therefore, the objective of this work was to evaluate the polyphenolic composition of the same red wine aged with different alternative products and a small amount of oxygen for 120 days. Specifically, the effect of 2 types of seasoning and 3 types of toasting of chips and staves made from the wood of Q. pyrenaica Willd. was studied. The results showed that the size of the alternative product was the factor that determines the phenolic composition of the wines over the entire ageing process, independent of the seasoning or toasting method carried out on the wood.

AB Impact of drought under enriched CO2 atmosphere on ecophysiological and leaf metabolic response of the sub-mediterranean Q. pyrenaica oak was studied. Seedlings growing in climate chamber were submitted to moderate drought (WS) and well-watered (WW) under ambient ([CO2](amb) =400 ppm) or CO2 enriched atmosphere ([CO2](enr) =800 ppm). The moderate drought endured by seedlings brought about a decrease in leaf gas exchange. However, net photosynthesis (A(net)) was highly stimulated for plants at [CO2](enr). There was a decrease of the stomatal conductance to water vapour (g(wv)) in response to drought, and a subtle trend to be lower under [CO2](enr). The consequence of these changes was an important increase in the intrinsic leaf water use efficiency (WUEi). The electron transport rate (ETR) was almost a 20 percent higher in plants at [CO2](enr) regardless drought endured by seedlings. The ETR/Anet was lower under [CO2](enr), pointing to a high capacity to maintain sinks for the uptake of extra carbon in the atmosphere. Impact of drought on the leaf metabolome, as a whole, was more evident than that from [CO2] enrichment of the atmosphere. Changes in pool of non-structural carbohydrates were observed mainly as a consequence of water deficit including increases of fructose, glucose, and proto-quercitol. Most of the metabolites affected by drought back up to levels of non-stressed seedlings after rewetting (recovery phase). It can be concluded that carbon uptake was stimulated by [CO2](enr), even under the stomatal closure that accompanied moderate drought. In the last, there was a positive effect in intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi), which was much more improved under [CO2](enr). Leaf metabolome was little responsible and some few metabolites changed mainly in response to drought, with little differences between [CO2] growth conditions.

AB Many modern alcoholic beverages are subjected to ageing processes during which compounds extracted from wood contribute decisively to the overall beverage character. Wines represent a perfect example of beverage in which ageing is a crucial technological manufacturing step. During winemaking, producers accelerate chemical changes in wine composition by traditional and alternative methods, such as the use of oak wood barrels and/or oak wood chips. Our research aimed to investigate the overall volatile composition and sensory quality of red wines aged for two timeframes, namely, 1.5 and 3 months, and with two technological variants, i.e., American and French oak wood chips. Red grapes from the Feteasc neagr (Vitis vinifera) variety were harvested from a vineyard in the North-East region of Romania. Stir bar sorptive extraction and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (SBSE-GC-MS) was used to extract minor aromas present in wine samples. The results showed clear differences between wines treated with American and French oak chips. Furthermore, ageing for 3 months increased the concentration of cis-whiskey lactone and guaiacol in American oak-treated wine samples. For wines aged with French oak chips, we observed higher concentrations of furfural, 5-methylfurfural, 4-vinylguaiacol, and trans-whiskey lactone. The increased presence of chemical compounds in wine aged with French oak chips generated prominent smoky, licorice, and toasty aromas, whereas in wines aged with American oak chips, notes of vanilla, toasty, and cacao aromas were noticed. Moreover, red wines aged with American and French oak chips were discriminated by chemometric analysis, which confirmed the evolution of aroma compounds.

AB In Asturias, northern region of Spain, pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) with symptoms of disease such as cracks in the bark with dark exudates, was observed in June 2017. Two different bacteria were isolated from the recovered sample. The two bacteria were biochemically very similar and so were identified by 16S rDNA sequences. The sequence of strain LPPA 3463 had 99% similarity with that of the type strain of the species Brenneria goodwinii Denman et al., and the sequence of strain LPPA 3461 showed the same result with respect to the sequence of the type strain of the species Gibbsiella quercinecans Brady et al. For more accurate identification, gyrB and atpD genes were also sequenced. Pathogenicity tests were initially carried out by puncture with the two bacteria on acorns and after 15 days, a rotten area was observed in the nuts while the controls, inoculated with sterile water, remained healthy. B. goodwinii and G. quercinecans have been consistently associated with Acute Oak Disease (AOD) affecting native oak trees in the UK, usually with presence of galleries produced by the buprestid beetle Agrilus. However, larval galleries of the Agrilus were not present in the pedunculate oak sample. G. quercinecans was reported in Spain on both Quercus ilex L. (holm oak) and Q. pyrenaica Willd. (pyrenean oak), but not on Q. robur. The bacterium B. goodwinii has not been described in Spain, and consequently this is the first report of these bacteria in pedunculate oak in Spain.

AB The plant variability in the southern Iberian Peninsula consists of around 3500 different taxa due to its high bioclimatic, geographic, and geological diversity. The deciduous forests in the southern Iberian Peninsula are located in regions with topographies and specific bioclimatic conditions that allow for the survival of taxa that are typical of cooler and wetter bioclimatic regions and therefore represent the relict evidence of colder and more humid paleoclimatic conditions. The floristic composition of 421 samples of deciduous forests in the south-central part of the Iberian Peninsula were analyzed. The ecological importance index (IVI) was calculated, where the most important tree species were Quercuspyrenaica, Aceropalus subsp. Granatensis, and Corylusavellana. These species are uncommon in the south-central part of the Iberian Peninsula, forming forests of little extension. An analysis of the vertical distribution of the species (stratum) shows that the majority of the species of stratum 3 (hemicriptophics, camephytes, geophites, and nanophanerophytes) are characteristic of deciduous forests, and their presence is positively correlated with high values of bioclimatic variables related to humidity and presence of water in the soil (nemoral environments), while they are negatively correlated with high values of bioclimatic variables related to high temperatures, evapotranspiration, and aridity. This work demonstrates that several characteristic deciduous forest taxa are more vulnerable to disappearance due to the loss of their nemoral conditions caused by gaps in the tree or shrub canopy. These gaps lead to an increase in evapotranspiration, excess insolation, and a consequent loss of water and humidity in the microclimatic conditions.

AB Needle nematodes have an economic importance by causing damage to a wide range of natural and cultivated plants not only by directly feeding on root cells, but also by transmitting plant nepoviruses. Two new Longidorus nematodes, Longidorus oakcrassus n. sp. and Longidorus oakgracilis n. sp., are described and illustrated from populations associated with the rhizosphere of Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica Wild.) in southern Spain. The taxonomic position of both new species within the genus was assigned using an integrative approach. Morphologically, L. oakcrassus n. sp. is characterized by a female with a large and robust body size (9.2-12.2 mm), lip region anteriorly flattened to slightly rounded and almost continuous or slightly offset by a depression with body contour, ca 25.5-32.0 mu m wide, amphidial fovea with slightly asymmetrical lobes, stylet composed by an odontostyle moderately long (110.0-133.5 mu m) and odontophore weakly developed, pharynx short ending in a terminal pharyngeal bulb with common arrangement of pharyngeal glands, tail short almost hemispherical shape. Longidorus oakgracilis n. sp. is characterized by having a moderately long and thin female body (5.4-7.9 mm in length), a bluntly-rounded lip region, set off from body contour by a slight depression, amphidial fovea funnel-shaped without lobe, odontostyle moderately long (94.0-106.0 mu m), pharyngeal bulb with common arrangement of pharyngeal glands, short tail, bluntly hemispherical. The presence of males is common in both species. Integrative diagnosis was based on molecular data using D2-D3 expansion domains of the 28S rRNA, 18S rRNA, ITS1 rRNA and partial coxI gene sequences and morphology. Although different gene markers show variations in the phylogenetic relationships, phylogeny indicated that L. oakcrassus n. sp. is phylogenetically related with several species described from the Iberian Peninsula, including L. oakgracilis n. sp., which is clustered with L.cf. olegi, L. lusitanicus and L. silvestris.

AB Latitudinal and elevational gradients provide valuable experimental settings for studies of the potential impact of global warming on forest tree species. The availability of long-term phenological surveys in common garden experiments for traits associated with climate, such as bud flushing for sessile oaks (Quercus petraea), provide an ideal opportunity to investigate this impact. We sequenced 18 sessile oak populations and used available sequencing data for three other closely related European white oak species (Quercus pyrenaica, Quercus pubescens, and Quercus robur) to explore the evolutionary processes responsible for shaping the genetic variation across latitudinal and elevational gradients in extant sessile oaks. We used phenotypic surveys in common garden experiments and climatic data for the population of origin to perform genome-wide scans for population differentiation and genotype-environment and genotype-phenotype associations. The inferred historical relationships between Q. petraea populations suggest that interspecific gene flow occurred between Q. robur and Q. petraea populations from cooler or wetter areas. A genome-wide scan of differentiation between Q. petraea populations identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) displaying strong interspecific relative divergence between these two species. These SNPs followed genetic clines along climatic or phenotypic gradients, providing further support for the likely contribution of introgression to the adaptive divergence of Q. petraea populations. Overall, the results indicate that outliers and associated SNPs are Q. robur ancestry-informative. We discuss the results of this study in the framework of the postglacial colonization scenario, in which introgression and diversifying selection have been proposed as essential drivers of Q. petraea microevolution.

AB Many studies have shown that honey with high phenolic contents prevents cancer formation. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that honey can be used for the treatment of cancer as well as cancer prevention. Antineoplastic effects of honey are often associated with their antioxidant phenolic contents. However, very few studies have dealt with the association of phenolic contents of honeys in terms of antiproliferative effects. The aim of this study was, therefore, to elucidate the cytotoxic, genotoxic, apoptotic, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating effects of honey samples on the basis of their phenolic and flavonoid contents. Fourteen different honey varieties were collected from various parts of Turkey, and their characteristics regarding total phenols, flavonoids, and antioxidant contents were determined to test their effects on gastric cancer cells (AGS). For convenience, 2 honey varieties were selected, namely, Ida Mountains Quercus pyrenaica honeydew honey (QPHH-IM) having the highest phenolic and antioxidant content and Canakkale multifloral honey (MFH-C) with the lowest phenolic and antioxidant content. Levels of 11 different phenolic compounds in QPHH-IM and MFH-C samples were determined by LC-MS/MS. AGS cells were incubated with different concentrations of QPHH-IM and MFH-C for 24 hours, then the cell viability, DNA damage, apoptosis, and generation of ROS were determined. We found that QPHH-IM had more cytotoxic, genotoxic, and apoptotic effects than that of MFH-C. We think that these effects are probably related to pro-oxidant activities due to the high phenolic contents present. Therefore, further research on high-phenolic honey may contribute to the future development of cancer therapeutics.

AB Trees are essential natural resources for ecosystem balance, regional development, and urban greening. Preserving trees has become a crucial challenge for society. It is common for the use of invasive or even destructive techniques for health diagnosis of these living structures, and interventions after visual inspection. Therefore, the dissemination and implementation of increasingly less aggressive techniques for inspection, analysis and monitoring techniques are essential. The latest high-definition thermal cameras record thermal images of high resolution and sensitivity. Infrared thermography (IRT) is a promising technique for the inspection of trees because the tissue of the sap is practically on the surface of the living structure. The thermograms allow the identification of deteriorated tissues and to differentiate them from healthy tissues, and make an observation of the tree as a functional whole body. The aim of this study is to present, based on differences in the temperatures field given by the thermal images, a qualitative analysis of the status of two different arboreal species, Quercus pyrenaica Willd and Olea europaea L. The results show the IRT as an expeditious, non-invasive and promising technique for tree inspection, providing results that are not possible to reach by other methods and much less by a visual inspection. The work represents a contribution to make IRT a tree decision-making tool on the health status of trees.

AB There is restricted knowledge about the potential impact of the use of different wood species on color and anthocyanin changes during the red wine aging process. This lack of knowledge is even greater when no oak wood species are used. Thus, the aim of this study was to carry out a comparative analysis of the impact of wood chip extracts from oak, acacia, and cherry species on the color characteristics and anthocyanins changes using synthetic wine solutions. In this context, several methodologies were used to quantify, color, and anthocyanins changes during the aging time studied. The results indicated that the contact between wood chip extracts and grape skin isolated anthocyanin extracts induced a decrease of color intensity (particularly red color), and the anthocyanin content in the different experimental synthetic wine solutions studied. All chromatic modifications are potentially detected by human eyes because Delta E values were much higher than 3 CIELab units. These tendencies seem to be independent of the wood species used, but are more pronounced for higher contact time between wood chip extracts and anthocyanins. The obtained results may contribute to a better understanding of the chromatic changes of red wines when aged in contact with different wood chip species.

AB Aim Spatial variations of environmental conditions translate into biogeographical patterns of tree growth. This fact is used to identify the origin of timber by means of dendroprovenancing. Yet, dendroprovenancing attempts are commonly only based on ring-width measurements, and largely neglect additional tree-ring variables. We explore the potential of using wood anatomy as a dendroprovenancing tool, and investigate whether it increases the precision of identifying the origin of oak wood. Since different tree-ring variables hold different information on environmental conditions prevailing at specific times of the growing season-which vary between source regions-we hypothesize that their inclusion allows more precise dendroprovenancing. Location Europe, Spain. Taxon Quercus robur L., Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl., Quercus faginea Lam., Quercus pyrenaica Willd. Methods We sampled four oak species across Northern Spain, i.e. from the Basque country and Cantabria and-in the Basque country-from low to high elevation (topographic/latitudinal gradient). We measured multiple tree-ring variables to (a) extract complementary variables; (b) present statistical relations among them; (c) analyse region-specific variation in their patterns based on time-series of individual trees; and (d) determine underlying climate-growth relationships. Leave-one-out analysis was used to test whether a combination of selected variables allowed dendroprovenancing of a randomly selected tree within the area. Results A combination of latewood width (LW) and earlywood vessel size was used to pinpoint the origin of oak wood with higher precision than ring width or LW only. Variation in LW pinpointed the wood to east and west areas, whereas variation in vessels assigned wood to locations along a latitudinal/topographic gradient. The climatic triggers behind these gradients are respectively an east-west gradient in June-July temperature and a north-south gradient in winter/spring temperatures. The leave-one-out analyses supported the robustness of these results. Main conclusions Integration of multiple wood-xylem anatomical variables analysed with multivariate techniques leads to higher precision in the dendroprovenancing of ring-porous oak species.

AB A new species Ypsolopha rhinolophi Corley is described from northern Portugal and south-east France. It resembles Y. alpella (Denis & Schiffermuller, 1775) and Y. lucella (Fabricius, 1775) but shows clear differences from both species in DNA barcode and in male and female genitalia. Male genitalia of Y. lucella are illustrated for the first time. The new species has been collected at light, reared from larvae on Quercus pyrenaica Willd. and recognised from DNA barcode fragments obtained from droppings of horseshoe bats.

AB Recent research into the benefits of feeding pomegranate (Punica granaturn L.) peels or extracts to dairy cattle has suggested these supplements may increase the health and productivity of these animals. However, in Victoria, Australia, several cattle died after consuming large amounts of pomegranate fruit, causing suspicion about the safety of pomegranates to cattle. An in vitro bioassay mediated approach was used to purify and identify metabolites from a crude extract of pomegranate fruit obtained from the affected farm. The metabolites that are most likely to cause cytotoxicity to bovine kidney epithelial cells (MDBK) were identified as gallic acid (IC50 41.2 +/- 19.0 mu g/mL), ellagic acid, and punicalagin (IC50 314.1 +/- 110.7 mu g/mL). Although only small concentrations of gallic acid (8 mu g/mg dried extract) were detected in the pomegranate fruit extract, microbial metabolism of punicalagin (276.2 mu g/mg dried extract) in the rumen could result in the formation of substantial amounts of gallic acid, potentially contributing to significant toxicity.

AB Forest species replacement can influence significantly the amount of carbon stored in the several compartments that compose the terrestrial ecosystems (biomass, forest floor and mineral soil). This study intends to evaluate the influence of the replacement of the Quercus pyrenaica species (QP), which represents the climax vegetation of Serra da Nogueira, NE Portugal, by the Pseudotsuga menziesii (PM) and Pinus nigra (PN) plantations (fast-growing species). For this purpose, three plots of 314 m(2) were established in each stand (9 plots in total) and the height and diameter at the breast height of all trees were measured, in order to characterize the stands and estimate the tree biomass. Herbaceous vegetation and forest floor were collected in areas of 0.49 m(2) in 15 points under each tree species (5 per plot). At the same points, disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected at depths 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20 and 20-30 cm. Thirty years after the climax vegetation replacement, carbon gains are observed in forest species biomass and forest floor (1.3 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) in PN and 4.0 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) in PM) and significant losses were recorded on soil carbon pool (about 2.2 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)). Total carbon accumulated is significantly higher in PM (331 Mg C ha(-1)) compared to PN (246 Mg ha(-1)) and QP (273 Mg C ha(-1)), which present statistically similar values. Tree biomass and mineral soil constitute the major carbon pools.

AB This work investigates the similarities and differences of oak honeydew (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) and evergreen honeydew (Quercus ilex L.) honey produced in Spain. For this purpose, the physicochemical characteristics of 17 samples from oak honeydew and 11 samples from evergreen honeydew collected in different geographical regions were analyzed. All the samples accomplished European Union requirements for honey consumption. Both honey types had amber dark color; however, the evergreen oak honey was clearer than oak honey, having higher mean values in a* and b* coordinates of CIELab scale. In general, both honey types exhibited high electrical conductivity, a moderate value of pH, medium to low water content, and high diastase activity. The reducing sugar content was significantly lower and maltose content was significantly higher in evergreen honeydew. In addition, total phenols and total flavonoid contents, the antioxidant activity and the melissopalynological analysis was performed. The oak honeydew honey had a higher abundance of Castanea, Rubus and Erica pollen grains, while the evergreen oak honeydew honey had a higher abundance of Lavandula, Olea europaea or Anthyllis cytisoides. A multivariate analysis using the most representative pollen types and physicochemical components facilitated the differentiation of the honey samples, thus this information can be useful for the honey characterization.

AB The establishment and maintenance of protected areas is the backbone of global conservation strategies to halt biodiversity loss. However, despite the more than 200,000 legally designated protected sites worldwide, the rate of species extinction has not decreased, for which some debate the real effectiveness of protected areas to preserve biodiversity. Using data from tropical areas, many studies have attempted to test the effectiveness of protected areas by comparing species richness in protected and neighbouring unprotected sites, without reaching a consensus. Here, we extend this line of research with data from temperate deciduous forests inside and outside Picos de Europa National Park and Biosphere Reserve (N Spain). Specifically we compare data from mixed broadleaved woodlands, beech forests (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) forests. We conducted botanical inventories and recorded ecological data from 25 0.2-ha concentric plots distributed in forest commons inside the reserve and from other 25 similar plots established in neighbouring not protected forest commons. Data were used to construct a set of ecological indicators and evaluated using modelling methods. We found no significant differences in species composition between plots in protected and non-protected forest commons, likely due to the similar management criteria applied in both land uses. We found less active management outside the protected area, which helps to maintain stands in a semi-natural state. In contrast, we observed the presence of silvicultural treatments inside the protected area, although these treatments were non-intensive, promoting vegetation composition associated to late-successional ecosystems. We only detected significant differences between plots inside and outside the protected area when relation between species richness was analysed with reference to forest habitat type. Precisely, plots of beech forests inside Picos de Europa were more homogenous than plots outside the protected area, which may indicate that management practices inside the protected area do not favour tree species diversity. Non-intensive silviculture management in beech forests inside Picos de Europa seems to promote the presence of the dominant tree species Fagus sylvatica L, which in the absence of perturbations is characterized by conforming monospecific vegetation communities. Overall, our results do not support the idea that protected areas hold more biodiversity than surrounding forest commons. Conservation treatments applied in protected areas should promote the presence of species associated to disturbances, particularly in stands tending to homogeneous species composition at late-successional stages, as this may enhance their resilience under the current rapid global changes.

AB Melojo oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) is a key tree species of Mediterranean forests; however, these forests show an advanced stage of deterioration in the Iberian Peninsula. Plant-associated microorganisms play an essential role improving their host's fitness, hence, a better understanding of oak rhizospheric microbiome, especially of those active members, could be the first step towards microbiome-based approaches for oak-forest improvement. Here we reported, for the first time, the diversity of total (DNA-based) and potentially active (RNA-based) bacterial communities of different melojo-oak forest formations through pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. We found that potentially active bacterial communities were as rich and diverse as total bacterial communities, but different in terms of relative abundance patterns in some of the studied areas. Both core microbiomes were dominated by a relatively small percentage of OT Us, most of which showed positive correlation between both libraries. However, the uncoupling between abundance (rDNA) and potential activity (rRNA) for some taxa suggests that the most abundant taxa are not always the most active, and that low-abundance OTUs may have a strong influence on oak's rhizospheric ecology. Thus, measurement of rRNA: rDNA ratio could be helpful in identifying major players for the development of bacterial bioinoculants.

AB The nomenclatural history of the scale insect Kermes roboris (Geoffroy, 1785) is reviewed. The authorship of this species is corrected in Geoffroy in Fourcroy, 1785 (or simply Geoffroy, 1785) and the synonymy of Lecanium quercus Burmeister, 1835 with Kermes roboris (Geoffroy in Fourcroy, 1785) is discussed and confirmed.
   Two new host plants of K. roboris are recorded from Spain: Quercus faginea Lam. and Q. pyrenaica Willd. First records of ant species associated to this scale insect are also given, namely Formica pratensis Retzius, 1783 and Lasius fuliginosus (Latreille, 1798), in addition to others Formicinae identified at genus level.
   The general and Italian distribution of K. roboris are reviewed, and the first record for the region Trentino-Alto Adige is given. Further new Spanish records from the web are also reported.

AB Today, there is a restricted knowledge about the potential impact of the use of different wood chip species on the white wine aging process. This lack of knowledge is even greater when wood species are used in blends of different species. Thus, the aim was to carry out a comparative analysis of the impact of different blends of wood chip species, involving oak and cherry wood, on different phenolic and color parameters, browning potential index and sensory profile of a white wine during the aging process. During the aging time studied, the use of wood chips induced an increase of wine phenolic content and color intensity, particularly in wines aged in contact with cherry wood chips alone or in blends with oak wood chips. A similar tendency was also detected for browning potential index. Regarding the sensorial results, the use of different wood chip species has an impact on the increase of "woody aroma" for the wines aged with oak wood chip species and also an increase of "body" and "astringency" descriptors for the wines aged with oak chips alone or blended with cherry chips. This work advances our understanding of the impact of different wood chip species separately or by the use of blends on white wine quality.

AB The study on wood physical properties of Quercus robur L., Quercus petraea (Marts) Liebl., and Quercus pyrenaica Willd., to use in wine aging was also founded on the relationship between porosity and void ratio to assess its variation in the oak species under study. A total of 45 oak trees were chosen in 15 oak stands of the Lugo and Ourense provinces (Galicia, northwestern Iberian Peninsula). Altogether, were obtained forty-five fine slices of wood at 60 cm tall on the trunk, and 194 wood test specimens' parallelepipeds of 20 x 20 x 40 mm +/- 1mm.
   On average, oak species in Galicia have lower porosity than oaks of the French regions of Limousin and Vosges. With a width of growth ring and age similar, Quercus pyrenaica has porosity slightly lower than Q. robur and Q. petraea. Our objective is to carry out a complete description on the wood physical properties of the studied species for its possible use in the cooperage industry and wine aging. For that, the aim of this work was to estimate the porosity versus the void ratio.

AB Adega do Casal Manteiga is a winery, publicly owned by the Municipality of Oeiras that produces Carcavelos fortified wine. Carcavelos fortified wine is an appellation of origin and demarcated as D.O.P. (Denominacao de Origem Protegida). This study examines the effects of barrels made from botanical species (Quercus pyrenaica, and Quercus robur) and toasting method (medium and high) on a single vintage wine that has been aged for 8 years. Twenty barrels were used, with five replicates for each factor. The barrels were fabricated and toasted using the same cooperage, J.M. Goncalves in Portugal. Significant differences were seen between the species Q. robur and Q. pyrenaica, with an impact on total phenolic content, including both flavonoids and non-flavonoids. The total phenols of the wine aged in Q. pyrenaica barrels was significantly higher than in the Q. robur barrels, and Q. pyrenaica contained more flavonoids than Q. robur in medium and high toast barrels. Q. pyrenaica showed more non-flavonoid compounds than Q. robur in high and medium toasted barrels, but this difference in non-flavonoids was only statistically significant in the high toasted barrels. The degree of toasting had significant effects on the flavonoid content of the wine, as well as the tanning power. Flavonoid content increased for both Q. pyrenaica and Q. robur in the wines that were aged in high tasted barrels compared to those that were medium toasted. The tannin power decreased for both Q. pyrenaica and Q. robur when the toasting increased.

AB Understanding how forest ecosystems influence the response of soil respiration (R-S) to climate drivers is essential to accurately predict soil carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes in a changing environment. This is particularly crucial in areas of contact between coniferous and broadleaved forests in the Mediterranean region which are already experiencing a warmer and drier climate. We present a case study in a Mediterranean ecotone forest where R-S components-heterotrophic (R-H) and autotrophic (R-A)- were monitored beneath pure Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) stands using the root-trenching method. We used generalized linear models to predict the soil CO2 efflux based on interactions between soil water conent (SWC) and soil temperature. Regardless of the tree species, we found that the strong and inverse water availability and thermal seasonality of the Mediterranean climate intensely constrained soil microbial activity. The incorporation of the soil temperature-moisture covariation thus greatly improved the quality of the models compared to approaches that consider soil temperature alone. We also identified species-specific responses influencing both the total amount of R-A and its sensitivity to environmental variables. Root respiration in the Scots pine stand showed greater vulnerability to the decline in SWC throughout the summer than in the oak stand. The R-A in the Pyrenean oak stand was mainly limited by low soil temperatures in winter, indicating low maintenance rates during vegetative dormancy. Mean annual R-H rates were highest in the Scots pine stand, probably driven by the larger litterfall rates and soil carbon (C) stocks; however, the apparent turnover rate of soil organic C in the oak stand was almost twice as fast as in the pine stand. While our observations are limited to a case study, our work shows that both soil moisture and forest composition can significantly control the temperature dependence of R-S components under a Mediterranean climate.

AB Contact of wine with wood during fermentation and ageing produces significant changes in its chemical composition and organoleptic properties, modifying its final quality. Wines acquire complex aromas from the wood, improve their colour stability, flavour, and clarification, and extend their storage period. New trends in the use of barrels, replaced after a few years of use, have led to an increased demand for oak wood in cooperage. In addition, the fact that the wine market is becoming increasingly saturated and more competitive means that oenologists are increasingly interested in tasting different types of wood to obtain wines that differ from those already on the market. This growing demand and the search for new opportunities to give wines a special personality has led to the use of woods within the Quercus genus that are different from those used traditionally (Quercus alba, Quercus petraea, and Quercus robur) and even woods of different genera. Thus, species of the genus Quercus, such as Quercus pyrenaica Willd., Quercus faginea Lam., Quercus humboldtti Bonpl., Quercus oocarpa Liebm., Quercus frainetto Ten, and other genera, such as Robinia pseudoacacia L. (false acacia), Castanea sativa Mill. (chestnut), Prunus avium L. and Prunus cereaus L. (cherry), Fraxinus excelsior L. (European ash), Fraxinus americana L. (American ash), Morus nigra L, and Morus alba L. have been the subject of several studies as possible sources of wood apt for cooperage. The chemical characterization of these woods is essential in order to be able to adapt the cooperage treatment and, thus, obtain wood with oenological qualities suitable for the treatment of wines. This review aims to summarize the different species that have been studied as possible new sources of wood for oenology, defining the extractable composition of each one and their use in wine.

AB Archaeological wood fragments from four Iberian shipwrecks (Belinho, Magdalena, Ribadeo and Yarmouth) and living tree cores of four oak species (Quercus faginea, Quercus petraea, Quercus pyrenaica and Quercus robur) were analysed by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and pyrolysis=gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS). The use of multivariate statistical methods (principal components analysis and discriminant analysis) to the data obtained with both techniques enabled to differentiate between the oak species studied with high probabilities, and provided less robust but meaningful information on the archaeological wood samples analysed. Most of the samples from the Magdalena shipwreck exhibited FTIR and Py-GC-MS signals that resembled those of either Q. petraea or Q robur. The geographical distribution of these species is concentrated in northwest Spain, where this frigate is known to have been built, supporting the hypothesised use of local forest resources. The chemistry of the fragments from the Belinho, Ribadeo and Yarmouth shipwrecks were more similar to wood from Q. faginea and Q. pyrenaica, also pointing to forest from the Iberian Peninsula as most likely source. Our results show that FTIR and Py-GC-MS, in combination with multivariate statistical methods, are promising tools for provenance studies of archaeological woods. However, the chemical features of wood from alternative areas and species need to be analysed to fully explore this potential.

TI Non-foraging tool use in European Honey-buzzards: An experimental test
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID BEHAVIOR; BIRDS
AB Examples of tool-use behaviors by birds outside foraging contexts are scarce and limited to a handful of species. We report a field experiment aimed to test whether an observed suite of odd behaviors by European Honey-buzzards (Pernis apivorus) represents use of green twigs cut from trees and woody shrubs as a tool to attract ants for anting. Specifically, we tested whether buzzards are selective in their choice of twigs, under the assumption that birds would prefer easy-to-collect twigs from plants that effectively attract ants. Experimental results lend support to our hypothesis that European Honey-buzzards cut green twigs of Montpellier maple trees (Acer monspessulanum) and, to a lesser extent, of Pyrenean oaks (Quercus pyrenaica) for their immediate use as ant attractors. Fresh twigs of both tree species attracted large numbers of ants, suggesting that their preferential use in the reported behavior of Honey-buzzards is not a random selection of the available plant material. Maple twigs, however, were the easiest to break and oak twigs the hardest compared to other plants in the community. This suggests that the relative ease of cracking of maple twigs may account for the preference Honey-buzzards have for this plant species as compared with Pyrenean oak, whose twigs demand considerable more effort from the birds to break. Our results lend support to the inclusion of the reported behavioral sequence by this raptor species as a potential example of tool use in birds outside the usual foraging context.

AB Key messageQuercussecondary forests show a gradual transition toward mixed forests, with sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) becoming increasingly abundant in the western Spanish Central System. Additionally, in chestnut-dominated stands, it shows a certain resistance to competitive displacement byQuercus pyrenaica. Our results partially refute the traditional view thatC. sativais unable to recruit in the absence of cultural inputs.ContextSweet chestnut, Castanea sativa, is a component of European broadleaf forests and is one of the most managed trees. Due to a reduction in cultural inputs, chestnut-dominated stands tend to be invaded by other species, and it is unclear how chestnut is able to persist in natural mixed forests.AimsOur work aimed to identity the main factors that limit the establishment of C. sativa and to analyze the recruitment and mortality processes of C. sativa trees.MethodsThe age, growth ring patterns, regeneration density, and the spatial structure of trees and saplings in 11 plots in the Spanish Central System were analyzed.ResultsChestnut seedling density increased with C. sativa basal area, but transition toward the sapling stage appeared limited owing to light availability. In Quercus pyrenaica secondary forests, sparse canopies did not constrain chestnut regeneration, and in old chestnut stands, C. sativa showed a certain resistance to competitive displacement. By contrast, mixed young coppices showed a high mortality, most likely due to competition with other vigorous resprouters.ConclusionQuercus secondary forests showed a gradual transition toward mixed forests with sweet chestnut becoming increasingly more abundant. In old stands, C. sativa is likely to persist under a gap-phase mode of regeneration. Our results partially refute the traditional view that C. sativa is unable to recruit in the absence of cultural inputs.

AB Different oak species or origins have been studied to find an alternative to traditional ones and Quercus humboldtii from Colombia is a candidate. Some studies analyse the composition of this oak, but no work has been found to study its use for wine treatment. The aim was to evaluate volatile composition of toasted Q. humboldtii oak chips and the wines treated with these chips. To evaluate its oenological potential Q. alba and Q. petraea have been included in this trial. The wines were subjected to a sensory analysis. Results indicated that oak chips and wines macerated for 90 days with toasted Colombian chips exhibited higher 5-methylfurfural, guaiacol, trans-isoeugenol and syringol concentrations than others, while the furfural and cis-beta-methyl-gamma-octalactone content was lower. Sensory analysis showed that the wines treated with Colombian oak presented more notes of smoked and less of coconut. Therefore, this oak could probably be considered suitable for ageing.

AB We review the role of the oak barrel as an active vessel for wine maturation. We present a historical background to highlight that previously established aspects of processes occurring with wine inside the oak barrel are still without confirmation. We argue that recently published new findings on the topic are determining factors in defining the manner in which the oak barrel works with wine. Several studies have been published reviewing how the wine barrel functions as an active vessel that releases chemical compounds into the wine, improving its physical, chemical, and sensory properties. Nevertheless, there are hardly any studies that describe how a wine barrel functions as an active vessel. The present review details the main factors affecting the gas exchange capacity of the barrel, such as the pressure drop generated within the barrel, the formation of a headspace, the effect of wood anatomy, the different oxygen entry routes, the role of wood moisture content and soluble ellagitannins, and the effect of barrel toasting on cooperage. Finally, a hypothesis is proposed regarding the function of the barrel as an active vessel, which determines the manner in which it interacts with the wine that it contains during aging.

AB Persistence of native forests is a global concern. We aimed at unveiling the main factors affecting tree recruitment in Portuguese native forests, modelling sapling data collected during the 5th Portuguese Forest Inventory, for five main Quercus taxa. Zero-inflated count data models allowed us to examine simultaneously (i) the absence of tree recruitment and (ii) the density of tree recruitment. Using Akaike weights, we obtained importance values for 15 relevant explanatory variables. Results showed that seed availability and climatic variables were determinant to understand regional absence of regeneration for all taxa. Seed availability was also an important driver of sapling density, except for Quercus suber. Other variables impacted on regeneration density: grazing hindered Q. suber regeneration; regeneration of Q. rotundifolia and Q. suber was lower in flat areas; recurrent fire hampered the regeneration of Q. robur and Q. pyrenaica; Q. broteroi and Q. pyrenaica showed depressed regeneration in regions where forest plantations abound, while Q. robur and Q. suber seemed selectively protected. We conclude that caution is warranted when analysing pooled data for Quercus spp. regeneration, as different variables affected Quercus taxa differently. Finally, we suggest dedicated management actions to enhance the establishment of new native forests.

AB The proportion of planted forests in the Mediterranean Basin is one of the largest in the world. These plantations are dominated by pine species and present a series of characteristics such as low elevation, high competition or small tree size that make them more vulnerable to droughts. However, quantitative assessments of their post-drought growth resilience in accordance with species, site factors and tree characteristics are lacking. In this study we sampled 164 trees at four forest sites located in the drought-prone Sierra Nevada, southeastern Spain. We compared growth responsiveness to drought in rear-edge planted vs. relic natural Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and coexisting Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) stands. Our objective was to characterize and compare the different growth responses to drought between species and sites and the effect of the main physiographic factors (altitude, aspect, and slope) on these responses since the influence of these factors on post-drought resistance and resilience has received little attention to date. Our results reveal that the planted pine sites with the lowest mean growth rates displayed greater resistance during drought, and that higher altitude was associated with improved resistance and/or resilience for all species and sites. Natural pine and Pyrenean oak stands were better adapted to the dry climatic conditions of the Mediterranean region where the study was undertaken, displaying greater resistance and/or resilience and lower influence of drought on growth in comparison to stands of planted pines. These results suggest that promoting the conservation of high-elevation pine plantations and enhancing the regeneration of natural pine and oak may improve the resistance and resilience of these drought-prone forest ecosystems.

AB Quercus pyrenaica is one of the most widespread species in pure or mixed stands across the Iberian Peninsula. It mostly occurs in mountain areas within the Mediterranean region, but also dominates forests along the boundary to the Atlantic northern Iberia. Given this role as a transitional species, the understanding of its behavior is of great relevance in a context of climate change.
   We analyzed five Q. pyrenaica stands in northwestern Iberia, located along a transect of increasing elevation in the Atlantic/Mediterranean biogeographical boundary. Tree-ring chronologies were obtained by measuring the earlywood vessel size, and the radial increment on a representative number of trees. Three variables were used, namely (i) the hydraulically-weighted diameter for the earlywood vessels in the first row (D-H-rl), (ii) for vessels outside this row (D-H-nrl), and (iii) the latewood width (LW). Variable chronologies were compared to monthly meteorological records, and to the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO).
   LW variation was controlled by water availability during late spring-early summer all throughout the study area, but differences among sites were mostly driven by the presence of abrupt growth changes linked to forest disturbance regime. In contrast, earlywood responses were modulated by the topographic position. The three low-elevation sites, located at windward of a central mountain range, were related to environmental conditions during quiescence, whereas the two others responded at the moment of wood formation; DH-rl was more controlled by climate than DH-nrl. The close association between NAO and vessel size was in accordance with the elevation gradient.
   Our results showed relevant signals related to micro-, meso-, and macroclimatic conditions, and pointed out to the existence of cause-effect relationships. Therefore, the combined time-series analysis of earlywood vessels and latewood increment is a powerful tool to understand the ecological behavior of marcescent oaks in marginal populations, which often dominate transitional areas.

AB This study presents a reanalysis of ozone (O-3) exposure experiments performed on deciduous broadleaf oak species in the Mediterranean region and a proposal of critical levels to improve the O-3 risk assessment in this area for these widely distributed forest species. Two experiments performed in Spain and Italy were considered, and the following 3 oak species were studied: Quercus pyrenaica, Q. faginea and Q. robur. All the experiments were performed with irrigated potted seedlings growing in Open-Top Chambers exposed to different O-3 levels (with charcoal-filtered air as the control treatment) for two consecutive growing seasons. The Phytotoxic Ozone Dose above an instantaneous threshold of 1 nmol O-3 m(-2) s(-1) (POD1) was calculated by applying a Jarvis type model for the estimation of the stomatal conductance (g(s),), and by adopting a big-leaf resistive scheme to account for the O-3 deposition on the vegetation. Two parameterisations were used for the g, multiplicative model: one species-specific based on the "local" g(s) measurements performed during each experiment, and the other "generic" based on the "Deciduous Mediterranean broadleaf" parameterisation described in the Manual on Methodologies and Criteria for Mapping Critical Loads and Levels and Air Pollution Effects, Risks and Trends of the UN/ECE (CLRTAP, 2015). The two different parameterisations were used to derive dose-response functions and ozone critical levels for the biomass loss of the deciduous oak species. The dose-response functions for roots and total biomass were statistically significant, with both the parameterisations tested (p < 0.05). The O-3 critical levels obtained indicate that deciduous broadleaf oaks in Mediterranean environment could be more tolerant to O-3 than other European broadleaf species and that O-3 is more harmful to the below-ground biomass of the plants rather than the above-ground biomass.

AB Over the centuries, oak wood has been used in the maturation process of alcoholic beverages imparting aroma and flavor notes. Whereas several studies have dealt with the impact of oak wood on the chemical composition of, for example, wine aroma, only limited information is available on the odorant composition of unmodified and raw oak wood itself. To close this gap, a combination of human sensory and chemo-analytical techniques was applied for the elucidation of the chemical composition of oak odor, comprising extraction of the volatile fraction of oak wood by means of solvent-assisted flavor evaporation (SAFE) and subsequent mild concentration of the distillate. Odor extract dilution analysis (OEDA), which is based on gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O), was then applied for the targeted characterization of the odor-active compounds. Overall, a total of 97 odorants was identified via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactometry (GC-MS/O) and heart-cut two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactometry (2D-GC-MS/O). The majority of these odorants comprised a series of terpenes, mainly mono- and sesquiterpenes, aldehydes, acids, and lactones, as well as a number of odorants containing a phenolic core moiety. Several odorants are reported here for the first time as volatile organic compounds in oak wood. Identification of the molecular composition of oak wood odor helps to establish a better understanding of the distinctive smell of oak wood, and offers the basis for unveiling its potential effects on humans when being exposed to oak wood smell in daily life.

AB We obtained tree-ring chronologies for pedunculate oak along an altitudinal gradient of four sites in NW Iberia, which covers most of the species range within the region. Trees grow under Atlantic climate, with a rainfall maximum in autumn-winter, and a minimum during summer, but lacking a remarkable drought. Chronologies included several earlywood anatomical features and ring widths, which were compared to each other. Latewood width and a subset of six earlywood variables were selected for further analyses, considering the period 1954-2003.
   The lowest site considerably differed from the rest of the gradient due to its milder conditions. Earlywood and latewood were unrelated at the three upper sites, and both compartments responded to different climatic factors. Hydraulic conductivity determined by vessel size was used to describe tree performance, which was modulated by temperature along the gradient. We hypothesize that the main processes involved are the timing of earlywood formation and carbohydrate dynamics. Water availability during late spring and summer affected latewood width, but only at low elevation.
   This paper illustrates the complexity of analyzing climate-growth relationships in oceanic areas under the absence of a prevailing limiting factor, while providing a feasible explanation of potential mechanisms involved.

AB The use of alternative oak products (AOP) for wine aging is a common practice in which micro-oxygenation (MOX) is a key factor to obtain a final wine that is more stable over time and with similar characteristics as barrel-aged wines. Therefore, the oxygen dosage added must be that which the wine is able to consume to develop correctly. Oxygen consumption by red wine determines its properties, so it is essential that micro-oxygenation be managed properly. This paper shows the results from the study of the influence on red wine of two different MOX strategies: floating oxygen dosage (with dissolved oxygen setpoint of 50 mu g/L) and fixed oxygen dosage (3 mL/L.month). The results indicated that the wines consumed all the oxygen provided: those from fixed MOX received between 3 and 3.5 times more oxygen than the floating MOX strategy, the oxygen contribution from the air entrapped in the wood being more significant in the latter. Wines aged with wood and MOX showed the same color and phenolic evolution as those aged in barrels, demonstrating the importance of MOX management. Despite the differences in the oxygen consumed, it was not possible to differentiate wines from the different MOX strategies at the end of the aging period in contact with wood.

AB In Mediterranean mountains, Pinus sylvestris L. is expected to be displaced under a warming climate by more drought-tolerant species such as the sub-Mediterranean Quercus pyrenaica Willd. Understanding how environmental factors drive tree physiology and phenology is, therefore, essential to assess the effect of changing climatic conditions on the performance of these species and, ultimately, their distribution. We compared the cambial and leaf phenology and leaf gas exchange of Q. pyrenaica and P. sylvestris at their altitudinal boundary in Central Spain and assessed the environmental variables involved. Results indicate that P. sylvestris cambial phenology was more sensitive to weather conditions (temperature at the onset and water deficit at the end of the growing season) than Q. pyrenaica. On the other hand, Q. pyrenaica cambial and leaf phenology were synchronized and driven by photoperiod and temperatures. Pinus sylvestris showed lower photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency and higher intrinsic water-use efficiency than Q. pyrenaica as a result of a tighter stomatal control in response to summer dry conditions, despite its less negative midday leaf water potentials. These phenological and leaf gas exchange responses evidence a stronger sensitivity to drought of P. sylvestris than that of Q. pyrenaica, which may therefore hold a competitive advantage over P. sylvestris under the predicted increase in recurrence and intensity of drought events. On the other hand, both species could benefit from warmer springs through an advanced phenology, although this effect could be limited in Q. pyrenaica if it maintains a photoperiod control over the onset of xylogenesis.

AB Whole tree harvesting was conducted on two coppice stands with different tree composition (Q. ilex and Q. pyrenaica) in gentle terrain. Felling and bunching were performed by a drive-to-tree wheeled feller-buncher with disc saw head. Operations were analyzed on 17 plots 25x25 m(2) in order to develop productivity models and to assess operational costs. The study also aimed at determining biomass collection efficiency and evaluating the impact of the new harvesting method on the soil, the remaining trees and stumps. The treatment consisted in a strong coppice thinning leaving standards. Productivity ranged from 2.8 to 4.6 odt/pmh in the Q. ilex coppice, and from 0.9 to 2.6 in the Q. pyrenaica stand. Tree species, dry weight per tree and percentage of removed basal area were the main independent variables affecting productivity. Approximately 50% of the standards showed damages. Most wounds were light, caused by the drive-to-free work pattern, followed through GPS tracking. Soil damage was also light; in no plots, deep disturbances were found. However, most of the stumps were damaged. Forwarding and chipping productivity and cost were also evaluated. The slash left on the terrain averaged 3.0 and 1.5 odt/ha in Q. ilex and Q. pyrenaica, respectively, including scrub debris. As a conclusion, while this heavy feller-buncher can be useful in coppice heavy thinnings with larger trees, it would be a good option to try lighter disc saw felling heads mounted on the harvester boom tip, which probably would reach better productivity and reduce the frequency of stand damage.

AB Climate change forecasts are particularly severe for the western Mediterranean Basin, where rising temperatures and decreased precipitation could increase the frequency of drought events. Understanding the specific weather drivers of radial variation in Mediterranean mixed forest stands will allow us to better predict the ecological and production alterations that may result from climate change. Here, we studied species differences in stem daily radial variation cycles and daily radial increment of Mediterranean pine-oak (Pinus pinaster-Quercus pyrenaica) mixed stands over three climatically contrasted years (2012-2014) at two sites with dissimilar drought conditions. Our aim was to uncover differences in the weather drivers of daily radial variation for the two co-existing species. High-resolution point dendrometers were installed in dominant oak and pine trees, so that daily radial variation cycles were analyzed. Linear mixed models were fitted to analyze species-specific response to weather. Air temperature leads to radial stem-size changes in daily variation cycles with different species responses. Precipitation increased daily radial variation and cycle duration in the same way for both species. Daily radial increment and number of cycles with increment phase during spring was mostly higher for pine than oak, and water availability was the most important control factor for the phase mentioned. Differences in species response to weather conditions may offset the usual low production of pure oak coppice Mediterranean stands and highlight the role of mixed forests as a possible adaptation strategy for climate change.

AB The Holocene vegetation dynamics of low- and mid-altitude areas of inland Iberia remain largely unknown, masking possible legacy effects of past land-use on current and future ecosystem trajectories. Here we present a 4000-year long palaeoecological record (pollen, spores, microscopic charcoal) from a mire located in the Caballeros National Park (Toledo Mountains, central Spain), a region with key conservation challenges due to ongoing land-use changes. We reconstruct late Holocene vegetation history and assess the extent to which climate, land-use and disturbances played a role in the observed changes. Our results show that oak (Quercus) woodlands have been the main forested community of the Toledo Mountains over millennia, with deciduous Quercus pyrenaica and Quercus faginea more abundant than evergreen Quercus ilex and Quercus suber, particularly on the humid soils of the valley bottoms. Deciduous oak woodlands spread during drier periods replacing hygrophilous communities (Betula, Salix, hygrophilous Ericaceae) on the edges of the mire, and could cope with fire disturbance variability under dry conditions (e.g. ca. 3800-3000-1850-1050 BC- and 1300-100 cal BP-AD 650-1850-) as suggested by regional palaeoclimatic reconstructions. Pollen and coprophilous fungi data suggest that enhanced fire occurrence at ca. 1300-100 cal BP (AD 650-1850) was due to deliberate burning by local people to promote pastoral and arable farming at the expense of woodlands/shrublands under dry conditions. While historical archives date the onset of strong human impact on the vegetation of Caballeros to the period at and after the Ecclesiastical Confiscation (ca. 150-100 cal BP, AD 1800-1850), our palaeoecological data reveal that land-use was already intense during the Arab period (ca. 1250-900 cal BP, AD 700-1050) and particularly marked during the subsequent City of Toledo's rule (ca. 700-150 cal BP, AD 1250-1800). Finally, we hypothesize that persistent groundwater discharge allowed the mires of the Toledo Mountains to act as interglacial hydrologic microrefugia for some hygrophilous woody plants (Betula, Myrica gale, Erica tetralix) during pronounced dry spells over the past millennia.

We aimed at assessing how coppicing has influenced root and shoot development and related carbon loss ascribed to maintenance of woody tissues in Quercus pyrenaica. For this goal, results from published studies on root dynamics, woody biomass and respired CO2 fluxes in an abandoned Q. pyrenaica coppice were integrated and extended to quantify overall respiratory expenditures of above- and below-ground woody organs. Internal and external CO2 fluxes together with soil CO2 efflux were monitored in eight stems from one clone across a growing season. Stems and roots were later harvested to quantify the functional biomass and scale up root and stem respiration (R-R and R-S, respectively) to the clone and stand levels. Below- and above-ground biomass was roughly equal. However, the root-to-shoot ratio of respiration (R-R/R-S) was generally below one. Relatively higher R-S suggests enhanced metabolic activity aboveground during the growing season, and highlights an unexpected but substantial contribution of R-S to respiratory carbon losses. Moreover, soil and stem CO2 efflux to the atmosphere in Q. pyrenaica fell in the upper range of reported rates for various forest stands distributed worldwide. We conclude that both R-S and R-R represent an important carbon sink in this Q. pyrenaica abandoned coppice. Comparatively high energetic costs in maintaining multiple stems per tree and centennial root systems might constrain aboveground performance and contribute to coppice stagnation.

AB A quantitative method was tested to describe crown phenophases in relation to water content and to secondary growth in ring-porous species, based on the hypothesis that new shoots require hydrated tissues to maintain the necessary turgor for extension, leading to a reduction in dry matter content (DMC). We collected a three-year-old branch from 11 Quercus pyrenaica Willd. trees at 10-day intervals to estimate DMC of newly developing buds, leaves, and twigs, and processed two opposite stem microcores for xylogenesis. Branch phenophases and shoot length were recorded in the field. The DMC of all organs decreased during crown development, with a minimum in early June, followed by a gradual increase up to initial values in late September. The shoot extension period concurred with the lowest DMC, but also with the beginning of earlywood maturation in the main stem, suggesting a high tissue hydration only when earlywood vessels become functional to fulfill enough water requirements for shoot and leaf extension. These results confirm the usefulness of DMC to accurately quantify the phenology of primary growth from bud swelling up to full leaf extension, as a complement to qualitative methods. This variation in DMC appears to be linked to secondary growth as a result of earlywood vessel development.

AB Sustainable production of wood is one of the main services provided by forest systems. Site productivity in the case of forests is often evaluated through the site quality. However, most of the works addressing the site quality have been done at local or regional scale. In this work, we aim to develop site quality models for five dominant species in Spanish forests (Fagus sylvatica, Pinus pinaster adantica, Quercus pyrenaica, Films nigra, Pinus sylvestris) and create site quality maps at a national-scale from these models. First, we develop site quality models using site form (height-diameter relationship) as the reference index and the Spanish National Forest Inventory as dataset. Then, we fit spatial additive models entering physiographic and climatic variables in order to predict the site quality over the whole country. Additionally, we plot site form maps for the five species in order to describe spatial pattern in site quality at a national scale. Altitude and aspect appeared to be fundamental variables in the assessment of site quality. The accuracy of the spatial additive models ranged from 38.2% to 47.9%. The correspondence between the predicted and observed maps of site qualities is clear. Our results provide a tool which could be used by forest managers in land use planning as well as in forest policy decision-making at a national scale. We suggest that this method could be used in other countries and that the maps could be expanded to the European scale to assessing the way in which site quality varies across Europe always considering that the relationships between forest productivity and environmental variables could vary among biogeoclimatic zones.

AB Global change-driven forest succession may modify key soil processes with potentially important impacts over carbon (C) and nutrient cycling. We studied how changes in litter throughout the replacement of Pinus sylvestris by Quercus pyrenaica influence the structure and functioning of soil microbial communities and the capacity of soils to sequester C and retain nitrogen (N). We designed a microcosm experiment to simulate the chronological sequence from pine to oak forest conversion in Central Spain, using mixtures of senescent litter (oak leaves, pine needles and an equal mixture of needles:leaves) and soils (from pure oak, mixed and pure pine stands). We investigated changing patterns of soil C and N contents, microbial community structure (PLFA) and greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2, CH4, N2O) across the chronosequence. The succession from pine to oak forest was associated with substantial changes in microbial community structure and functioning. Soil-C sink capacity was reduced, although soil-N availability was enhanced, We further show how effects of secondary succession on the C cycle were mismatched with N dynamics in response to two chronologically decoupled facts. First, there was an acceleration in soil organic matter (SOM) turnover after microbial-especially bacterial-growth ceased to be so intensely inhibited by needle litter (ecotone soils), resulting in lower fungal to bacterial ratios; and second, N mineralization was stimulated once pine-derived SOM was no longer present in soils (pure oak forest soils), resulting in further acceleration of SOM turnover, suppression of CH4 consumption and an increase in gram negative bacteria. Our findings suggest that different sensitivities of key mechanisms (SOM decomposition, N mineralization, CH4 consumption) to factors associated with succession (e.g. recalcitrance of pine SOM and allelopathic effects over bacteria) could have significant impacts on soil microbial ecology, C and nutrient cycling.

AB There is a need to incorporate soil information into distribution and growth models of forest plant species. This information is particularly scarce for Pinus nigra ssp. salzmanii Arn in La Rioja. The soils, microclimate, vegetation, and growth of this species were studied in 18 sample plots in plantations in central La Rioja. Soils with clay iluviation (Alfisols and Argiudolls) predominate on piedmont sediments, while Inceptisols and Mollisols predominate on limestone, and Entisols and Alfisols on siliceous sandstone and mudstone. Soils were rarely classified within lithic or shallow taxa. Site index at age 30 years for P. nigra varied between 5.5 m and 11.5 m, and increased with increasing rootable depth and pH, coarse fragments, and sand content, and decreased with increasing concentration of exchangeable magnesium in the surface mineral horizon of soils. The specific composition of the spontaneous vegetation was related both to soil and climate variables but also to the site preparation techniques used for plantation. Soil information is an essential requirement to understand ecosystem functioning.

AB Pollen analyses supported by fifteen AMS C-14 dates from Fuente de la Leche (1382 m) and Fuente del Pino Blanco (1343 m) peat sequences, in the Gredos range (central Spain), are used to reconstruct the late Holocene vegetation history in this mountain region. These results are compared with other sequences from the Spanish Central System in order to better understand the past dynamics of the main forest constituents and to provide a critical view of the dialectic between conifers and deciduous forests. The vegetation record at Fuente de la Leche starts at 3000 cal yr BP, with the occurrence of rather closed forests composed of Pinus sylvestris and Betula. Pinus sylvestris was the dominant pollen taxa for almost the entire period. However, during the last 850 years, Pinus sylvestris forests were progressively replaced by Quercus pyrenaica woodlands and grasslands, as a result of a high pastoral pressure, until forming mixed woodlands similar to 400 years ago. The interpretation of Fuente del Pino Blanco record is that dramatic changes started about 265 years ago. Prior to this date, an open canopy woodland included species (Alnus glutinosa, Quercus pyrenaica) whose distributions no longer exist in the studied area. We suggest that the increase in agricultural (rye and other cereals) and livestock activities forced a change in the role of fire in the supramediterranean belt of the Gredos range, thus Pyrenean oak canopy was consumed by fires, providing openings for Pinus pinaster and broom communities better adapted to fire.

AB Chemical cues play a fundamental role in mate attraction and mate choice. Lepidopteran females, such as the winter moth (Operophtera brumata), emit pheromones to attract males in the reproductive period. However, these chemical cues could also be eavesdropped by predators. To our knowledge, no studies have examined whether birds can detect pheromones of their prey. O. brumata adults are part of the winter diet of some insectivorous tit species, such as the great tit (Parus major) and blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus). We performed a field experiment aimed to disentangle whether insectivorous birds can exploit the pheromones emitted by their prey for prey location. We placed artificial larvae and a dispenser on branches of Pyrenean oak trees (Quercus pyrenaica). In half of the trees we placed an O. brumata pheromone dispenser and in the other half we placed a control dispenser. We measured the predation rate of birds on artificial larvae. Our results show that more trees had larvae with signs of avian predation when they contained an O. brumata pheromone than when they contained a control dispenser. Furthermore, the proportion of artificial larvae with signs of avian predation was greater in trees that contained the pheromone than in control trees. Our results indicate that insectivorous birds can exploit the pheromones emitted by moth females to attract males, as a method of prey detection. These results highlight the potential use of insectivorous birds in the biological control of insect pests.

AB The analytical and sensory analysis of wines aged in barrels of French and American oak with three different levels of toasting was performed to determine the relationship between the volatile substances released by oak wood and sensory appreciation by a trained panel. For that purpose, a discolored white wine of Macabeo and a red wine of Cabernet Sauvignon from 2012 vintage were aged for 12 months in new barrels. Similar wines from the following vintage were aged in the same barrels for knowing how the use of the barrels affects their capacity to release volatile substances and its organoleptic impact. A significant correlation was found between the appreciation of coconut and smoked/toasted notes by the panel and the theoretical sensory impact of beta-methyl-gamma-octalactone and volatile phenols, respectively, in two different wines aged in new oak barrels. Vanillin correlated significantly in only one of the wines tasted. The panelists generally preferred wines aged in medium-toasted new barrels for both oak species. In a triangle test, tasters could distinguish between wines aged in new American and French oak barrels when the toasting level was light or medium but not when it was heavy. They were also able to distinguish between wines aged in new and 1-year-used barrels. It can be concluded that the botanical origin of the oak, the toasting level of the staves and the number of times that the barrels have been used previously have a real impact on the volatile composition of the wine and in its sensory impact.

AB The ability of trees to cope with climate change is a pivotal feature of forest ecosystems, especially for rear-edge populations facing warm and dry conditions. To evaluate current and future forests threats, a multi-proxy focus on the growth, anatomical and physiological responses to climate change is needed. We examined the long-term xylem adjustments to climate variability of the temperate Quercus robur L. at its rear edge and the sub-Mediterranean Quercus pyrenaica Willd. Both species coexist at a mesic (ME, humid and warmer) and a xeric (XE, dry and cooler) site in northern Spain, the latter experiencing increasing temperatures in recent decades. We compared xylem traits at each site and assessed their trends, relationships and responses to climate (1960-2008). Traits included basal area increment, earlywood vessel hydraulic diameter, density and theoretical-specific hydraulic conductivity together with latewood oxygen (delta O-18) stable isotopes and delta C-13-derived water-use efficiency (iWUE). Quercus robur showed the highest growth at ME, likely through enhanced cambial activity. Quercus pyrenaica had higher iWUE at XE compared with ME, but limited plasticity of anatomical xylem traits was found for the two oak species. Similar physiological performance was found for both species. The iWUE augmented in recent years especially at XE, likely explained by stomatal closure given the increasing delta O-18 signal in response to drier and sunnier growing seasons. Overall, traits were more correlated at XE than at ME. The iWUE improvements were linked to higher growth up to a threshold (similar to 85 mu mol mol(-1)) after which reduced growth was found at XE. Our results are consistent with Q. pyrenaica and Q. robur coexisting at the central and dry edge of the climatic species distribution, respectively, showing similar responses to buffer warmer conditions. In fact, the observed adjustments found for Q. robur point towards growth stability of similar rear-edge oak populations under warmer climate conditions.

AB The impact of climate on xylem structure and function has been profusely studied for a variety of species in the last decades, but the ecological role of ring porosity under increasing levels of environmental stress has been scarcely assessed. In this study, we analyse the timing of earlywood vessels occlusions by tyloses in two ring porous species with contrasting ecological strategies (Quercus robur and Q. pyrenaica) along a seasonal drought gradient, and relate it to variations in earlywood vessel diameter and radial growth obtained from tree-ring series. The number of trees showing tyloses increased in summer as a result of more frequent cavitation events under drier conditions, and was more reduced for the more drought-tolerant Q. pyrenaica, which had a higher hydraulic diameter (D-h) but lower latewood increments. D-h values decreased towards the wettest sites, and were negatively related to warm and rainy conditions in winter. Our results showed that large earlywood vessel diameters are not necessarily accompanied by high rates of tyloses formation or limited growth in summer. We hypothesize that trees in seasonal environments can take advantage from large earlywood vessels, because benefits from a more efficient hydraulic system during favourable periods are higher than the risk of xylem impairment in summer.

   PERFORMANCE; RESPONSES
AB Plants emit herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) when they are attacked by herbivorous arthropods to attract natural enemies of the herbivores. Previous studies have suggested that insectivorous birds can detect the HIPVs for prey location. The production of HIPVs is partly mediated by the jasmonic acid signalling pathway. Methyl jasmonate is one compound involved in the jasmonic acid signalling pathway. Therefore, spraying of methyl jasmonate (MeJa) solution on plants can induce the emission of volatiles similar to the HIPVs induced by herbivory. We performed two field experiments to test whether insectivorous adult birds are attracted to Pyrenean oak trees (Quercus pyrenaica) treated with MeJa solutions. We used artificial larvae to measure bird predation rate. There were no differences in the predation rates of plasticine larvae between control and MeJa treatments, suggesting that insectivorous birds were not attracted to trees treated with MeJa. We also tested whether blue tit nestlings without previous experience in foraging respond to the scent of Pyrenean oak tree leaves treated with MeJa, to test whether the attraction to MeJa-treated trees is innate. A similar number of nestlings performed begging responses when exposed to the scent of leaves of MeJa-treated trees compared to the scent of leaves of control untreated trees. Furthermore, the duration of the first begging was similar in response to the volatiles emitted by MeJa-treated trees and untreated trees. Despite previous evidence suggesting that insectivorous birds are attracted to HIPVs, our results show that neither insectivorous adult birds nor inexperienced nestlings were attracted to trees treated with MeJa. Further studies are needed to disentangle whether the differences in the emission of volatiles between herbivore-infested trees and MeJa-treated trees can explain this lack of attraction to MeJa-treated Pyrenean oak trees.

AB Iberian Mediterranean forests are mainly dominated by Quercus species, which belong to different sections of the genus characterized by the condition of leaves, sclerophyllous vs. deciduous. There are also other Fagaceae-dominated forests such as beech forest, but they are considered relict and have a restricted distribution on mountains. Sclerophyllous oak forest covers the biggest part of the area, mainly in valleys or plateaus, while deciduous forests are distributed along mountain ranges where the higher amount of precipitation compensates for the typical dryness of Mediterranean climate. As examples we can mention Q. canariensis or Q. pyrenaica that have functional particularities, i.e. a marcescent leaves that only fall when the new ones appear, and have a quite restricted distribution so that they are considered endemic species. Although the widespread sclerophyllous forests of Quercus rotundifolia cover a large area, there are other types that are of ecological, chorological, and climatic interest. This is the case for cork oak forest (Q. suber) or olive woodlands (Olea sylvestris), that are also treated in this paper. We have also included some azonal vegetation types, mainly deciduous forests, present along riverbeds in extended areas of Mediterranean Iberia.

AB Our research about wood physical properties of Quercus robur L., Q. petraea (Matts) Liebl., and Q. pyrenaica Willd., for cooperage was founded on the calculate of wood grain to estimate the change of this property in the Galician oaks. Overall, 45 trees were selected in 15 oak forests of the provinces of Lugo and Ourense (Galicia, NW Spain), of which we obtained 45 thin slices of wood at 60 cm tall on the trunk, and 194 wood samples parallelepipeds of 2 x 2 x 4 cm +/- 1mm.
   The grain of Quercus pyrenaica and Q. robur are similar to oaks Limousin region, France. Quercus petraea is comparable to the Vosges oaks. Now, both regions are among the most important sources in quality oaks for manufacturing barrels. Our global objective was to realize a detailed description on the physical properties of wood of these species for its possible use in industry cooperage. For this, the aim of this second work was to continue with the study of wood grain.

AB Mediterranean oak forests of the Iberian Peninsula host a great diversity of saproxylic beetles. For centuries, humans have carried out traditional management practices in this area, at both habitat and tree level, causing changes in forest structure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anthropic effect of these traditional practices on saproxylic beetle diversity by measuring a set of environmental variables related to forest structure at both plot and tree level. Fauna was collected using window traps over a period of 12 mo. Multiple regression procedures showed which variables significantly affected the diversity of the studied assemblage. Our results demonstrated that the different metrics used to assess the diversity of assemblages responded variably depending on the management strategies applied and the level at which they were carried out. Certain management practices that disrupted the landscape from its natural state, such as the introduction of livestock or the local removal of particular trees, maximized species richness but, nevertheless, had a negative effect on the rest of diversity metrics analyzed. However, other practices such as pollarding, which involves the suppression of the main branch of the tree, had a positive effect on all diversity metrics evaluated as it promoted the formation of potential microhabitats for saproxylic fauna. We concluded that not all types and degrees of traditional forest management favor saproxylic beetle diversity and that different diversity metrics should be taken into consideration in future strategies for the protection and conservation of this fauna.

AB Tree interception loss from two Mediterranean oak species, Quercus ilex (Q.i.) and Quercus pyrenaica (Q.p.), was estimated during 2-year period (1 October 2011 to 30 September 2013) in sparsely vegetated Sardon catchment (similar to 80 km(2), Spain) by: i) rainfall, throughfall and stemflow measurements; ii) Gash model temporal extrapolation; and iii) remote-sensing spatial upscaling. The annual, measured tree interception losses (I-m) of Q.i. and Q.p. in the first year were 51% and 16% of P (335 mm) and in the second, 46% and 10% of P (672 mm), respectively. The revised Gash analytical model of rainfall interception loss, extrapolated well the Im temporal variability of Q.i. and Q.p., provided the throughfall-based, and not Pennman-Monteith-based, average wet canopy evaporation rates were used. Finally, a novel method of spatial upscaling of a tree-based interception loss into plot- and catchment-scale, using per-species, reference tree interception loss and object-attributes derived from satellite imagery, was proposed. The interception losses from Q.i. and Q.p. were upscaled first into two homogeneous plots (1-ha each and both with similar to 20% canopy cover), one with Q.i. and the other with Q.p. oaks and then into the entire Sardon catchment with similar to 7% canopy cover. The obtained annual-mean, plot interception losses were 9.5% of Pin evergreen Q.i. and 2.5% of Pin deciduous Q.p. plot. The annual-mean catchment interception loss was 1.4% of P. The proposed upscaling method is expected to improve catchment water balances, replacing common arbitrary or literature based tree interception loss estimates. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

AB The main objective of this work is to investigate the uptake of several radionuclides by the vegetation characteristic of a dehesa ecosystem in uranium mining-impacted soils in Central-West of Spain. The activity concentration for U-238, Ra-226, Pb-210, Th-232, and Ra-224 was measured in soil and vegetation samples using a Canberra n-type HPGe gamma-ray spectrometer. Transfer factors of natural radionuclides in different tissues (leaves, branches, twigs, and others) of native plants were evaluated. From these data, the influence of the mine, the physicochemical parameters of the soils and the type of vegetation were analyzed in order to explain the accumulation of radionuclides in the vegetation. A preferential uptake of Pb-210 and Ra-226 by plants, particularly by trees of the Quercus species (Quercus pyrenaica and Quercus ilex rotundifolia), has been observed, being the transfer factors for Ra-226 and Pb-210 in these tree species higher than those for other plants (like Pinus pinaster, Rubur ulinifolius and Populus sp.). The analysis of radionuclide contents and transfer factors in the vegetation showed no evidence of influence of the radionuclide concentration in soils, although it could be explained in terms of the type of plants and, in particular, of the tree's species, with special attention to the tree's rate of growth, being higher in slow growing species.

AB Altitude significantly affects vegetation growth and distribution, including the developmental stages of a forest. We used shotgun Illumina sequencing to analyze microbial community composition and functional potential in melojo-oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) rhizospheric soil for three different development stages along an altitudinal gradient: (a) a low altitude, non-optimal site for forest maintenance; (b) an intermediate altitude, optimal site for a forest; and (c) a high altitude, expansion site with isolated trees but without a real forest canopy. We observed that, at each altitude, the same microbial taxa appear both in the taxonomic analysis of the whole metagenome and in the functional analysis of the methane, sulfur and nitrogen metabolisms. Although there were no major differences at the functional level, there were significant differences in the abundance of each taxon at the phylogenetic level between the rhizospheres of the forest (low and intermediate altitudes) and the expansion site. Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were the most differentially abundant phyla in forest soils compared to the expansion site rhizosphere. Moreover, Verrucomicrobia, Bacteroidetes and Nitrospirae phyla were more highly represented in the non-forest rhizosphere. Our study suggests that rhizospheric microbial communities of the same tree species may be affected by development stage and forest canopy cover via changes in soil pH and the C/N ratio.

AB A complete characterization of the phenolic profile of leaves infusions from seven Mexican Quercus species was developed using different LC-DAD-MS/MS methodologies. The main families of phenolic compounds identified and quantified were: hydrolyzable tannins and flavonol glycosides, based on their fragmentation patterns and UV spectra, proanthocyanidins analyzed after acid-catalysis in the presence of phloroglucinol, and phenolic acids evaluated using UPLC-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (QqQ). White oak species showed the largest amount of total phenols (830-2956 mg/L) with hydrolyzable tannins as the predominant group (60-96%), mainly vescavaloninic acid, vescalagin, and castalagin. Red species (total phenolics 129-280 mg/L), showing proanthocyanidins as the dominant family, consisted of units of catechin, gallocatechin and in less amount epicatechin gallate and epigallocatechin gallate and larger percentages of phenolic acids (10-19%).

AB QuestionsCan shrubs (Cytisus multiflorus) and large herbivore exclusion (fence) facilitate seedling survival and growth of marcescent and sclerophyllous oaks (Quercus pyrenaica vs Q. ilex subsp. ballota) under a bioclimatic limit in Mediterranean grazed areas?
   LocationOpen oak woodlands, central-western Spain.
   MethodsA 2-yr field experiment was conducted by planting 200 seedlings of each Quercus species under four different treatments combining the influence of nurse shrubs and fencing on Quercus seedling survival and growth.
   ResultsCytisus multiflorus enhanced poor Quercus seedling survival found in the study area, at least during the first 2yr after planting and particularly during the first dry season. The improvement in soil organic matter under the shrub canopy may have contributed to this positive effect, which was more pronounced on Q.pyrenaica seedlings. Seedling herbivory did not seem to be a limitation to survival. Increased seedling growth in both species was also very low, and no growth was recorded 2yr after planting without shrubs. The positive shrub effect on seedling growth, especially marked in fenced areas, was more important in Q. pyrenaica in the first growing period and in Q. ilex in the second; 2yr after planting no difference in shrub effect on growth was found in either Quercus species. Seedling herbivory was a limitation to seedling growth in areas without shrubs, mainly in the case of Q. pyrenaica.
   ConclusionsIn Mediterranean grazed areas with important summer drought and very sandy soil, shrubby C. multiflorus plants have a clear facilitative effect on seedlings of ecologically contrasted Quercus species. The facilitative effect was found in both marcescent and sclerophyllous oak seedlings, but to a different degree depending on the species considered and the variable measured (survival or growth). In terms of survival, the marcescent species was more favoured by shrub cover than the sclerophyllous one, and this effect was accentuated through time. However, in terms of growth, although Q. pyrenaica was initially more favoured by shrubs, differences between the two species were attenuated after 2yr. Therefore, C. multiflorus can have a key role in restoration of these oak degraded environments.

AB The aim of the present work was to characterization and compare acorns from selected Quercus spp. from the Mediterranean forest in Spain, namely, Portuguese oak (QF, Quercus faginea Lam.), Cork oak (QS, Quercus suber L.), Pyrenean oak (QP, Quercus pyrenaica Wild), Kermes oak (QC, Quercus coccifera L.), Holm oak (QB, Quercus ilex L. subsp. ballota [Desf.]). All physicochemical attributes varied significantly between species. Fat contents ranged from 1.30 to 4.70 g 100 g(-1) fresh matter. The most abundant fatty acids were oleic (62.44, 56.25, 57.46, 48.02, 65.83%), followed by linoleic (16.42, 20.73, 21.30, 25.38, 14.17%) and palmitic (11.69, 14.27, 12.17, 16.22, 12.28) acids in QF, QS, QP, QC and QB species, respectively. The tocopherol content was high in the range of 31.83-45.25 mg kg(-1), and gamma-tocopherol constituted 67-78% of total tocopherols. Only an effect of the location on gamma-tocopherol content in QB was observed. The present results show the potential of different species of acorn to be used as agricultural and food resources and that geographical location plays a secondary role.

AB The temporal factor has been widely neglected in studies related to species distribution. However, knowing the species phenology throughout the year could be a key element in ecological studies, more so considering the current climate change framework. The intra-annual temporal patterns of the saproxylic beetle assemblage inhabiting the oak forests in the western Iberian Peninsula were evaluated in terms of species richness and composition. Moreover, we analysed the temporal patterns of species richness and body size, with respect to the abiotic factors of temperature and relative humidity. The marked seasonality of the Mediterranean weather governed, to a great extent, the temporal patterns of the assemblage, as both species richness and body size showed a positive correlation with temperature and a negative correlation with relative humidity. The high temperatures reached in August limited the activity of certain species, causing a marked decrease in species richness. The results revealed that species body size decreased in the colder months of the year and vice versa, which could fit with the inverse of Bergmann's rule; nevertheless, studies are needed to address the contribution of species physiology and autoecology to the observed temporal patterns. Regarding species composition, the partition of beta diversity in its two components showed a constant process of species turnover throughout the year. We conclude that, due to global warming, the study of temporal patterns of assemblages is becoming all the more important, since it could significantly affect the spatio-temporal distribution of species and the interactions between them.

AB Climatic scenarios for the Mediterranean region forecast increasing frequency and intensity of drought events. Consequently, a reduction in Pinus sylvestris L. distribution range is projected within the region, with this species being outcompeted at lower elevations by more drought-tolerant taxa such as Quercus pyrenaica Willd. The functional response of these species to the projected shifts in water availability will partially determine their performance and, thus, their competitive success under these changing climatic conditions. We studied how the cambial and leaf phenology and xylem anatomy of these two species responded to a 3-year rainfall exclusion experiment set at their elevational boundary in Central Spain. Additionally, P. sylvestris leaf gas exchange, water potential and carbon isotope content response to the treatment were measured. Likewise, we assessed inter-annual variability in the studied functional traits under control and rainfall exclusion conditions. Prolonged exposure to drier conditions did not affect the onset of xylogenesis in either of the studied species, whereas xylem formation ceased 1-3 weeks earlier in P. sylvestris. The rainfall exclusion had, however, no effect on leaf phenology on either species, which suggests that cambial phenology is more sensitive to drought than leaf phenology. P. sylvestris formed fewer, but larger tracheids under dry conditions and reduced the proportion of latewood in the tree ring. On the other hand, Q. pyrenaica did not suffer earlywood hydraulic diameter changes under rainfall exclusion, but experienced a cumulative reduction in latewood width, which could ultimately challenge its hydraulic performance. The phenological and anatomical response of the studied species to drought is consistent with a shift in resource allocation under drought stress from xylem to other sinks. Additionally, the tighter stomatal control and higher intrinsic water use efficiency observed in drought-stressed P. sylvestris may eventually limit carbon uptake in this species. Our results suggest that both species are potentially vulnerable to the forecasted increase in drought stress, although P. sylvestris might experience a higher risk of drought-induced decline at its low elevational limit.

AB In increasingly fragmented landscapes tree plantations are thought to help maintain forest continuity among native patches. Epiphytic lichens are one of the most sensitive groups to change in forest conditions, but the effects of this management practice are still poorly studied in temperate regions. In this study we compared epiphytic lichen diversity among small patches of old, native oaks (Quercus pyrenaica) and young, planted chestnuts (Castanea sativa) and Monterey pines (Pinus radiata) in a major forestry area in northwestern Spain. Our results showed that the richness of epiphytic lichens was higher in C. sativa than Q. pyrenaica, but that the latter had more lichen species typical of mature forests, including macrocyanolichens. Overall, C. sativa plantations had more species typical of well-lit, dry environments than Q. pyrenaica or P. radiata, which is likely caused by the natural architecture of each tree species, and to differences in forest age and management. At the tree level, Q. pyrenaica had the highest total richness including all species of conservation interest, which were exclusively found on this species. On a corollary, this study shows that Q. pyrenaica forests had the best preserved epiphytic lichen communities but with marked signs of forest fragmentation. In this fragmented landscape, young plantations of C. sativa and P. radiata seem to be of limited help for providing connectivity to epiphytic lichens among old native forest patches.

AB Old-growth forests, particularly those located at the interface between different bioregions, are unevaluable sources of long-term vegetation dynamics and historical stand response to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Although old-growth forests are scarce, the information gathered studying them may assist forest ecosystem restoration and management under forthcoming climate and land-use changes.
   We analysed how complementary dynamics of a mixed old-growth forest composed by temperate (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea) and submediterranean (Quercus pyrenaica) tree species were driven in response to global changes in the last two centuries. The old-growth forest, named El Hayedo de Montejo, is located at the interface between the Mediterranean and temperate bioregions in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula. The populations of temperate species growing in El Hayedo de Montejo (F. sylvatica and Q. petraea) are at the dry and warm edges of their natural distribution area in Europe, whereas the submediterranean species Q. pyrenaica is at the core of the distribution range. In order to analyse the long-term dynamics, we developed basal area increment and disturbance chronologies for each of the tree species under study. Furthermore, we assessed the climate influence on tree growth during the most recent decades.
   Our results reveal historical shifts in forest dominance (as reflected by growth) induced by changes in climate and forest management between temperate and sub-Mediterranean species. This was particularly noticeable for F. sylvatica and Q. pyrenaica the least and most drought-tolerant species, respectively. A reduction in growth of F. sylvatica unprecedented in the context of the last two hundred years was observed during the last decades concurrent with forest densification and marked changes in climate. Conversely, both oak species seem to be better suited to current environmental conditions as expressed by increasing growth rates. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB In the Mediterranean Basin, long-lasting human activities have largely resulted in forest degradation or destruction. Consequently, conservation efforts aimed at preserving and restoring Mediterranean forests often lack well-defined targets when using current forest composition and structure as a reference. In the Iberian mountains, the still widespread Pinus sylvestris and Quercus pyrenaica woodlands have been heavily impacted by land-use. To assess future developments and as a baseline for planning, forest managers are interested in understanding the origins of present ecosystems to disclose effects on forest composition that may influence future vegetation trajectories. Quantification of land-use change is particularly interesting to understand vegetation responses. Here we use three well-dated multi-proxy palaeoecological sequences from the Guadarrama Mountain central Spain) to quantitatively reconstruct changes occurred in P. sylvestris forests and the P. sylvestris-Q, pyrenaica ecotone at multi-decadal to millennial timescales, and assess the driving factors. Our results show millennial stability of P. sylvestris forests under varying fire and climate conditions, with few transient declines caused by the combined effects of fire and grazing. The high value of pine timber in the past would account for long-lasting pine forest preservation and partly for the degradation of native riparian vegetation (mostly composed of Betula and Corylus). Pine forests further spread after planned forest management started at 1890 CE. In contrast, intensive coppicing and grazing caused Q. pyrenaica decline some centuries ago (ca. 1500-1650 CE), with unprecedented grazing during the last decades seriously compromising today's oak regeneration. Thus, land-use history played a major role in determining vegetation changes. Finally, we must highlight that the involvement of forest managers in this work has guaranteed a practical use of palaeoecological data in conservation and management practice. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Radial increment analyses allow us to determine tree responses to weather and tree competition, thus enabling the development of management strategies for adapting forest stands to forecasted climate change scenarios. In this study, the responses of pine-oak mixed stands (Pinus pinaster Ait. and Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) to thinning treatments were assessed at two sites in central Spain with contrasting drought conditions. Inter-and intra-annual radial increments were recorded every two weeks from dendrometer band measurements, using a Latin square design. Each site consisted of a control (unthinned) and two thinning intensities: moderate (25% of pine basal area removed) and heavy (40% of pine basal area removed). Thinning effects were monitored over three years of different weather conditions (2010-2012), with an extreme drought event in 2012. Linear mixed models were fitted to analyze weather and thinning effects on the inter- and intra-annual radial increment rates. Additionally, the sum of two logistic functions was used to estimate cumulative radial increment patterns. Heavy thinning resulted in the greatest annual radial increment for pine, regardless of site and year, even during the 2012 drought, when compared to densely stocked forest stands. The model results indicated that heavy thinning positively affected the intra-annual pattern, increasing inflection point and spring and autumn asymptotes. Thinning also had a slight positive effect on inter- and intra-annual radial increment in oak, although this was not clear during extreme drought in 2012. The radial increment rate was related to weather variables, which reflected light (positive for solar radiation) and water availability dependence (increased with precipitation, but decreased with vapor pressure deficit) for both species. Besides water status, air humidity (positive relation with air temperature and relative humidity) also affected oak. Reducing competition by thinning stimulated radial increment in oak-pine mixed stands, which may provide an adaptive forest management tool for reducing tree vulnerability to extreme droughts, which are linked to climate change.

AB Leaf litter decomposition is a major pathway for nutrient recycling and a chief factor controlling ecosystem primary productivity. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of forest thinning on the early stage foliar decomposition rate and nutrient immobilization-release pattern in a mixed Quercus pyrenaica-Pinus pinaster forest growing in the western Mediterranean basin. Two thinning treatments, differing in the intensity of canopy reduction, were compared with a control (unthinned) situation. Oak leaves showed faster decomposition rates than pine needles in unthinned plots. Intense canopy reduction (40% of basal area removed) reduced decomposition rates in both species whereas intermediate reduction (25% of basal area removed) increased decomposition of needles to a rate similar to that of oak leaves. C and N transfer from N-rich to N-poor foliar litter was not detected, indicating a marginal role of canopy reduction in this process. A decoupling of the decomposition rate from immobilization-release pattern was found for mobile elements (K and Mg) at intermediate levels of canopy cover whereas Ca dynamics indicated that pine needles had not started the lignin-mediated degradation phase two years after incubation. We finally hypothesized that strong reductions of canopy cover in dry Mediterranean sites might have an aridification effect on litter decomposition. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We selected two sites dominated by the sub-Mediterranean oak Quercus pyrenaica Willd. close to its distribution boundary in northwestern Iberia, within a mountain region with a high winter precipitation. The sites differed in their soil water regime, corresponding to the edge of a peat bog, and to a moderate slope. We obtained tree-ring chronologies of total ring width (RW), and mean earlywood vessel area (MVA); their responses to climatic factors were compared for the period 1945-2002. RW presented a higher chronology quality than MVA, but was rather independent of climate, probably because of the presence of recurrent growth reductions. In contrast, MVA was closely related to precipitation during April and May, whereby a high water availability was coupled to smaller vessels. We found remarkable differences between the climatic signal of both stands, as trees growing on the peat soil responded later and with considerably lower intensity. We hypothesize that spring waterlogging causes that the response at the wettest site occurs only when soil desiccation begins, which results in a delayed climatic signal, and also lower intra- and inter-annual variation due to more homogeneous conditions. Climate-growth relationships at the driest site were mainly associated with the first row, whereas it is vessels expanding later in the season that show this relation for the moist site. Our results confirm that MVA chronologies are reliable proxies of both regional and local climatic conditions, but only a careful optimization by selecting vessel subsets does provide a complete view of their potential.

AB Many studies have shown evidence of very rapid natural colonization of trees on roadslopes. Tree colonization on roadslopes can be a useful tool in the ecological restoration of these degraded areas. However, little is known about the characteristics of the tree species capable of colonizing these novel habitats. Moreover, it is necessary to know how tree species respond to the two main limitations in these areas: microsite availability (i.e., roadslope characteristics) and seed arrival, which is related to propagule source, dispersion vector and landscape characteristics. The present study aims to investigate the natural colonization of tree species on roadslopes, as well as the factors determining their occurrence. We identified all tree individuals on 150 roadslopes, along 51 km of a motorway. A total of 1143 individuals belonging to 18 species was recorded. Most individuals found resulted from a natural colonization process, although we found various fruit trees (present in 7 roadslopes) and Robinia pseudoacacia (2 roadslopes), which are probably associated with unintentional human-mediated seed dispersal. Only the six most abundant species were analysed in detail: Populus nigra, Quercus ilex, Quercus pyrenaica, Fraxinus angustifolia, Salix spp. and Ulmus pumila. Each roadslope was characterized both by site variables and by surrounding variables. We analysed the effect of the descriptive variables on the occurrence and density of each species on the roadslopes, and we subsequently used decision trees (classification and regression trees) to analyse the combined effect of the different predictors considered. Our results show successful tree colonization on the roadslopes, although they appear to indicate limitations to colonization associated with the availability of propagules. Furthermore, tree species dispersed by animals required a continuous flow of seeds favoured by an appropriate community of seed dispersers and a suitable landscape structure. By contrast, wind-dispersed tree species basically need favourable site characteristics on the roadslopes. 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by plants play a critical role in the structure of the faunal communities that are associated with them. The aim of this work was to provide a detailed list of VOCs emitted by the oak species Quercus pyrenaica Willd. and to analyse the spatio-temporal variation in the emission rates of these compounds and in the diversity of saproxylic beetle assemblages associated with this tree species. VOCs sample collection was carried out by a dynamic flow-through enclosure technique with subsequent analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Statistical differences in the emission rates of VOCs and in the diversity of saproxylic beetles were found between seasons. Temperature and relative humidity seemed to be related to these variations. Spatially, neither qualitative nor quantitative statistical differences in the emission of VOCs were found. Nevertheless, the results demonstrated a trend such that larger trees emitted VOCs with higher intensity and hosted a greater diversity of saproxylic beetles. Our hypothesis that beetles responded to certain blends of VOCs emitted at different rates by potential host tress and not so much to the absence or presence of a particular compound was reinforced by the absence of qualitative differences in the VOCs emitted by trees of different sizes. These results open a new field of study, and it will be necessary to become more involved with the subject to evaluate the real influence of these VOCs released by trees in saproxylic beetle assemblages.

AB The Middle Spotted Woodpecker (Leiopicus medius) is a strict forest bird whose habitat preferences during the breeding season are well known. However, a lack of information about its habitat selection during the non-breeding season may hamper recommendations for the management and conservation of the species. Here we study habitat selection of this woodpecker at its southwestern boundary range (Izki Natural Park, northern Spain) during the non-breeding season (October-December) by means of a use-availability approach. We also examined seasonal differences in habitat use between the breeding season (April-May) and the non-breeding season. Results of ANOVA and backward-stepwise logistic regression revealed a clear selection of high forest cover, large Pyrenean oaks (Quercus pyrenaica), and presence of dead trees during the non-breeding season. Despite very similar habitat use in both seasons, minor but interesting differences between seasons were observed, with a potential expansion during the non-breeding season into less mature forests (lower forest cover and fewer large trees) with a greater abundance of dead trees. These differences may reflect seasonal changes in the spatial requirements of the species and a decrease in food abundance during autumn-winter. On the basis of these findings, we propose management measures to improve the conservation status of the species in the Iberian Peninsula.

AB Historical trajectories of tree species during the late Quaternary have been well reconstructed through genetic and palaeobotanical studies. However, many congeneric tree species are interfertile, and the timing and contribution of introgression to species divergence during their evolutionary history remains largely unknown.
   We quantified past and current gene flow events between four morphologically divergent oak species (Quercus petraea, Q. robur, Q. pyrenaica, Q. pubescens), by two independent inference methods: diffusion approximation to the joint frequency spectrum (partial derivative a partial derivative i) and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). For each pair of species, alternative scenarios of speciation allowing gene flow over different timescales were evaluated.
   Analyses of 3524 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) randomly distributed in the genome, showed that these species evolved in complete isolation for most of their history, but recently came into secondary contact, probably facilitated by the most recent period of postglacial warming.
   We demonstrated that: there was sufficient genetic differentiation before secondary contact for the accumulation of barriers to gene flow; and current European white oak genomes are a mosaic of genes that have crossed species boundaries and genes impermeable to gene flow.

AB Genetic, dendrochronological and physiological studies are reviewed to investigate causes of tree stagnation of abandoned Quercus pyrenaica coppices. Tree decline - displayed by slow stem growth, branch dieback and scarce acorn production - has led to advice on the conversion of abandoned oak coppices into high forests by thinning. However, this practice has often failed. The shortage of genetic diversity and disequilibrium between above- and below-ground organs in large, over-aged stools (clones) are adduced consequences of centenary coppicing driving stand stagnation in Q. pyrenaica. Our results evidence that historical coppicing has not enhanced genetic diversity losses; on the contrary, it has allowed for the recruitment of new genotypes and the existence of uneven-aged stands of heterogenic clonal structure. Tree excavations have revealed widely spread root systems. High carbon expenditures in root respiration in large and centennial clones may constrain their aboveground development, and thinning practices aiming at converting Q. pyrenaica coppices into high forests might not succeed or even enhance a physiological root-to-shoot imbalance.

AB Environmental conditions and the structure of the dormant cambium are assumed to affect seasonal patterns of cambial activity, hence controlling allocation of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) to growth. However, seasonal dynamics of xylogenesis, and their connections with NSC content and dormant cambium size, have been rarely assessed along an environmental gradient. We monitored xylogenesis and leaf phenology during 2012 and 2013, and NSC in 2012, for the drought-sensitive Quercus robur and the drought-tolerant Quercus pyrenaica along a water-availability gradient in the north-western Iberian Peninsula, and analysed dependencies of xylem production and phenology on the number of cells in dormant cambium. Study oak species showed comparable seasonal fluctuations in cambial activity and NSC content, despite Q.pyrenaica had a shorter growing season and a lower wood production than Q.robur. A sharp drop in spring NSC levels at all study sites evidenced that stored carbohydrates were crucial for earlywood formation. Under drier conditions, both species extended the growing period in spring and autumn, but reduced and even stopped xylogenesis in summer, showing an enhanced NSC accumulation before dormancy. A higher number of cells in dormant cambium of large dominant oaks accounted for their wider xylem increments and longer active periods. Our study demonstrates that xylogenesis is modulated by predisposing effects of dormant cambium size on xylem production and growing season length. Moreover, the high plasticity of cambial activity in deciduous oaks would confer resistance against recurrent summer drought through the improvement of the NSC status.

AB This work presents the results of a study on the variation of the chemical composition of Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) heartwood among different sites and its relationship with the soil chemical characteristics. The chemical characteristics of the heartwood are quantified in terms of proximate and ultimate analysis, calorific value and ash composition. Subsequently, the relationship between the wood chemical characteristics and the soil characteristics was also examined. The results showed no significant differences between the wood chemical characteristics from different sites. There are, however, significant differences between trees from the same site regarding the wood ash content, the calorific value and the contents of nitrogen and hydrogen. Strong correlations were observed between the heartwood ash contents of BaO, MnO, CuO and TiO2 and the soil nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium and the soil exchangeable base contents.

AB Studies disentangling the anthropogenic influences of traditional forest uses are crucial to assess the current conservation value of cultural landscapes. By promoting asexual regeneration, centenary coppicing in the predominantly root resprouter Quercus pyrenaica is assumed to have reduced genetic diversity levels contributing to the decline of abandoned coppices and the common lack of acorn production. This work aims to test the widespread assumption that historical coppicing in Q. pyrenaica has caused depleted levels of genetic diversity. Seven microsatellite markers were used to assess clonal structure and population genetic diversity levels in six abandoned coppices of Q. pyrenaica, which were compared to three open woodlands in national parks in Spain. Asexual regeneration was higher in coppices, leading to more frequent and larger clonal assemblies. Clonal diversity parameters (genotypic richness and proportion of unique genotypes) were significantly lower in coppices, although density of genotypes per surface area and levels of population genetic diversity were comparable to those observed in open parklands. Heterogenic clonal structures were found both within and among stands, hindering the inference of concrete anthropogenic disturbances. Despite promoting asexual reproduction, coppicing maintains high levels of genotypic and genetic diversity and allows the incorporation of new genotypes by seed recruitment. The natural resprouting capacity of Q. pyrenaica preserved the species in face of long-lasting anthropogenic disturbances, fostering ecosystem resilience and harbouring high conservation values.

AB Mapping pollen concentrations is of great interest to study the health impact and ecological implications or for forestry or agronomical purposes. A deep knowledge about factors affecting airborne pollen is essential for predicting and understanding its dynamics. The present work sought to predict annual Quercus pollen over the Castilla and Leon region (Central and Northern Spain). Also to understand the relationship between airborne pollen and landscape. Records of Quercus and Quercus pyrenaica pollen types were collected at 13 monitoring sites over a period of 8 years. They were analyzed together with land use data applying the Concentric Ring Method (CRM), a technique that we developed to study the relationship between airborne particle concentrations and emission sources in the region.
   The maximum correlation between the Quercus pollen and forms of vegetation was determined by shrubland and "dehesa" areas. For the specific Qi pyrenaica model (Q, pyrenaica pollen and Q. pyrenaica forest distribution), the maximum influence of emission sources on airborne pollen was observed at 14 km from the pollen trap location with some positive correlations up to a distance of 43 km. Apart from meteorological behavior, the local features of the region can explain pollen dispersion patterns. The method that we develop here proved to be a powerful tool for multi-source pollen mapping based on land use. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The use of new oak barrels and the demand for oak wood in oenology is increasing. Thus, it is necessary to search for new wood sources to supply the current demand in cooperage. The aim of this work was to study the composition of ellagitannins and low molecular weight phenolic compounds (LMWP) by HPLC-DAD of green wood Quercus humboldtii Bonpl. (Colombian), compared to the species typically used in cooperage: Quercus sessiliflora Salisb. (French and Romanian) and Quercus alba L. (USA). In Colombian oak wood, the same LMWP and ellagitannins as in the traditional species were identified. The most abundant LMWP was ellagic acid, and its concentration was lower in Q. humboldtii and Q. alba than in Q. sessiliflora, so these two presented a lower content of phenolic acids. As regards phenolic aldehydes, Colombian oak wood only showed significant differences in the content of coniferyl and sinapic aldehydes in relation to French oak. Finally, the total ellagitannin content of Q. humboldtii was lower than that of European oaks and similar to that of American oak (Q. alba). None of the ellagitannins studied presented significant differences compared to Q. alba. Therefore, Q. humboldtii wood was more similar in terms of phenolic composition to Q. alba than to Q. sessiliflora.

AB As climate is an important driver of vegetation distribution, climate change represents an important challenge to forestry. We (1) identify prevailing bioclimatic conditions for 49 relevant forest species in Portugal and (2) assess future shifts under climate change scenarios. We compute two bioclimatic indices (aridity and thermicity) and a new composite index, at similar to 1 km spatial resolution, and overlap with the species' current ranges. Locations are based on a digital inventory, while climate parameters for both recent-past (1950-2000) and future climates (2041-2060), under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, are provided by a multi-model ensemble of climate simulations. Results for future scenarios highlight an overall warming and drying trend. Supramediterranean and mesomediterranean climates will be significantly reduced, while thermomediterranean climates will dramatically increase, from their almost absence in current conditions to an area coverage of similar to 54 % in 2041-2060 for RCP8.5. There is also a clear shift from hyper-humid and humid to sub-humid and from the latter to semi-arid climates (area coverage of similar to 13 % in 2041-2060 for RCP8.5). Lower thermomediterranean sub-humid to semi-arid zones will cover the southern half of Portugal. These projections identify the most vulnerable (e.g. Betula pubescens, Quercus pyrenaica and Castanea sativa) and the most adapted (e.g. Quercus suber, Q. rotundifolia, Ceratonia siliqua, Pinus pinea, Quercus coccifera) species in future climates. Current bioclimatic zones associated with Eucalyptus globulus and Pinus pinaster, economically relevant species, will be moderately reduced and relocated. Possible adaptation measures are discussed to improve forest resilience to climate change, while maintaining its economic and environmental benefits.

AB Genus Quercus L. has been closely associated to humans throughout the history, with empirical evidences of such relationship before the appearance of Homo sapiens strictly speaking. Since then, mankind has obtained different basic resources from oaks, from acorns as food, charcoal for metal melting or wood as key material for different works. Such relation has been especially strong in some areas where oaks are considered as "tree of life" or "people's species". Moreover, the interest of scientists in the study of this genus has provided a lot of new discovers in different areas of the socalled plant sciences. Genus Quercus, comprising more than 400 species found throughout the Northern Hemisphere in a lot of contrasted habitats, have been the case study in many papers about taxonomy, palaeobotany, plant physiology or basic and applied ecology. This fact is summarized in this chapter, serving as a preface to this book.

AB The total phenolic composition and the sensory profile of an 'Encruzado' white wine aged in contact with chips from different wood species (cherry - Prunus avium, acacia - Robinia pseudoacacia, and two oak species - Quercus petraea and Quercus alba) were investigated over 28 aging days.
   During the short aging period studied, the use of wool chips, in particular from acacia wood, induced a tendency for increases of total phenols, non-flavonoid and flavonoid compounds and color intensity of white wines. In this sense, after 28 aging days white wine aged with acacia wood chips also showed significant color differences in relation to the control wine. The results also showed that white wines aged in contact with cherry and acacia wood chips maintained high browning potential values during the aging time investigated. From the sensory point of view, in general the white wines showed similar sensory profiles. However, concerning the overall appreciation the panel test preferred the white wine aged in contact with acacia chips, while the wine aged in contact with cherry chips showed similar overall appreciation scores to those obtained for the wines aged with oak wood chips. This work advances our understanding of the potential impact of other than oak woods, such as cherry and acacia on white wine quality.

AB Aim: The evolution of global phenolic parameters and the sensory profile of a Portuguese red wine aged for 90 days in contact with wood chips from different species were evaluated.
   Methods and results: For this purpose, wood chips from cherry (Prunus avium), acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia) and two oak species (Quercus petraea and Quercus pyrenaica) were added to a Portuguese red wine. Various global phenolic parameters of red wines were studied during the aging process (90 storage days). In addition, a sensory analysis was made after the 90-day aging period to determine the impact of the use of different wood chip species on red wine sensory profile. The results showed that during the aging period, only a few differences were detected between the wines. However, after 90 aging days, in general the wines aged in contact with cherry wood tended to have the lowest values for several phenolic parameters. For sensory parameters, the wine aged in contact with French oak chips showed significantly higher scores for several aroma descriptors, while for visual and taste descriptors no statistical significant differences were found between the wines.
   Conclusion: At the concentration used ( 3 g wood chips/L wine), the different wood chip species studied had no clear influence on the evolution of the majority of the red wine phenolic parameters. However, from a sensory point of view, the use of different wood species induced greater differentiation, especially for aroma descriptors.
   Significance and impact of the study: The outcomes of this study would be of practical interest to winemakers and regulatory institutions since they could improve the knowledge of the impact of alternative wood chip species, namely acacia and cherry, on red wine quality.

AB This paper presents the results of an ethnobotanical study in the upper region of the Pisuerga River in Palencia, Spain. The study was carried out by conducting semi- structured interviews of 50 residents above the age of 52. The total number of use reports was 2,879; 839 refer to plants used in human food and 247 are related to plants used in animal feed. Forty- two wild species have been cited for human consumption: 45.2% of them are exploited for their fruit, 33.3% are eaten as vegetables, and 28.6% are used to produce liqueurs. Twenty wild species have been cited as animal feed, six of which are also used as food for human consumption and 90% as fodder or hay. Of the species, 20% are used for their fruit, whether fresh or dried. The species of the highest interest for human consumption in the region were Corylus avellana, Prunus spinosa, Fragaria vesca and Sorbus aria. The plants that were cited most often as animal feed are Asphodelus albus, Quercus petraea and Q, pyrenaica. Conopodium pyrenaeum, locally called ajuerjano in Spanish, a common name unique to the region ("pignut" in English), was cited by more than 50% of interviewees. Conopodium majus is consumed in nearby regions. Conclusion: Wild food plants gathered in the region are not the population's main source of nutrients, but they are important resources that can be used to diversify recipes.

AB Our work on the physical properties of wood in hardwood species, Quercus robur L., Q. petraea (Matts) Liebl., and Q. pyrenaica Willd., for study its use in cooperage, began with the proportion appraisal of bark, sapwood, and heartwood, and its relationship with age, to know and assess the variation thereof in the Galician oaks. To properly perform our study, it was necessary to fell several Quercus trees within the study area (Galicia, NW Spain). In total, 45 trees were selected in 15 different stands located in the Galician provinces of Lugo and Ourense, from which we obtained 45 slices of wood at 60 cm height on the tree trunk. There are many anatomical differences between hardwood and softwood species; however wood parts of a tree system are common to both. The analysis of different proportions of bark, sapwood, and heartwood made it possible to reveal: i) the rapid growth of Quercus pyrenaica gives rise to the formation of large proportion of heartwood in a few years; ii) Quercus petraea has the largest proportion of heartwood, but the studied trees are older and their growth is slower than the other species; iii) Quercus robur has an intermediate growth between the other two species. Therefore, our aim was to carry out a complete description of these parts of the wood, later, in upcoming work estimate their physical properties for use in cooperage industry

AB Quantifying climate-growth associations is needed to evaluate how forest productivity will respond to climate change. Year-to-year fluctuations in forest productivity and radial growth are partly explained by local climatic conditions driven by large-scale atmospheric patterns. This is illustrated by Iberian forests in the western Mediterranean Basin, which are subjected to complex climatic and atmospheric influences such as Atlantic and Mediterranean cyclogenesis. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is one of the major atmospheric circulation patterns affecting Iberian forests since positive winter NAO phases lead to dry and warm conditions. The Western Mediterranean Oscillation (WeMO) may also explain Iberian forest growth in some areas since this index captures Mediterranean cyclogenesis and WeMO negative phases are linked to warm and wet spring to summer conditions. Here, we analyze the associations between atmospheric patterns, climate and tree growth and we determine if they are changing through time. We use dendrochronology to relate radial growth of four tree species (Pyrenean oak, Sweet chestnut, Maritime pine and Scots pine) growing in western Spain to climate conditions and the NAO and WeMO indices. Winter and early spring temperatures increased since the 1950s in the area whereas the negative association between winter precipitation and the NAO strengthened since then. However, mean temperature rise was particularly evident since the 1970s. Growth was reduced by dry conditions during the growing season (spring and summer), but also by cold and dry conditions during the previous autumn and winter. This explains why the NAO January and the WeMo April indices were negative to growth of three species excluding Pyrenean oak. The early 1970s reflected an inflection point in the instability of climate-growth associations in the study area. We conclude that the winter NAO is a relevant driver of forest growth in the western Iberian Peninsula forests but additional atmospheric patterns (WeMO) also affect, albeit to a minor extent, these forests.

AB To accurately estimate stem respiration (R-S), measurements of both carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux to the atmosphere (E-A) and internal CO2 flux through xylem (F-T) are needed because xylem sap transports respired CO2 upward. However, reports of seasonal dynamics of F-T and E-A are scarce and no studies exist in Mediterranean species under drought stress conditions. Internal and external CO2 fluxes at three stem heights, together with radial stem growth, temperature, sap flow and shoot water potential, were measured in Quercus pyrenaica Willd. in four measurement campaigns during one growing season. Substantial daytime depressions in temperature-normalized E-A were observed throughout the experiment, including prior to budburst, indicating that diel hysteresis between stem temperature and E-A cannot be uniquely ascribed to diversion of CO2 in the transpiration stream. Low internal [CO2] (<0.5%) resulted in low contributions of F-T to R-S throughout the growing season, and R-S was mainly explained by E-A (>90%). Internal [CO2] was found to vary vertically along the stems. Seasonality in resistance to radial CO2 diffusion was related to shoot water potential. The low internal [CO2] and F-T observed in our study may result from the downregulation of xylem respiration in response to a legacy of coppicing as well as high radial diffusion of CO2 through cambium, phloem and bark tissues, which was related to low water content of stems. Long-term studies analyzing temporal and spatial variation in internal and external CO2 fluxes and their interactions are needed to mechanistically understand and model respiration of woody tissues.

AB Fluvial tufa located in the Queiles and Val river valleys (Moncayo Natural Park, Iberian Range, NE Iberia), are investigated following morphostratigraphic descriptions, radiocarbon dating and palynological and anthracological analyses. The studied tufa deposits have been chronologically framed within the Early-Mid Holocene (ca. 9500 to 4000 cal yr BP) in agreement with regional tufa build-up. Similarly, both climatic and palaeoenvironmental conditions reconstructed for this period fit with regional data from lacustrine records. The obtained pollen profiles and charcoal results show the existence of a local riparian woodland, where diverse mesophytes like deciduous Quercus, Corylus, Salix, Populus, Ulmus, Juglans and Hedera define the main vegetation features in the river valleys. Unexpectedly, both pollen and anthracological data also place Taxus baccata and Castanea sativa populations growing near the study area, and denoting, in the case of chestnut, its native and long-term presence in the Iberian Range. Deciduous (Quercus faginea/pyrenaica type) and evergreen oaks (Quercus ilex/coccifera type) were the main spread regional forest which conformed the meso-Mediterranean vegetation belt of the Moncayo Range and borderlands, accompanied by many warm-loving shrubs like Olea, Phillyrea, Rhamnus and Pistacia, pointing out the optimal thermic period of the Holocene. Pine (Pinus nigra/sylvestris type) and montane broadleaved communities (Betula, Fagus) were usually confined to high-altitude elevations, but anthracological record also address local presence. The combination of pollen and charcoal analyses together with the dating tufa of buildups, represent an essential tool to complete the regional palaeoclimatic and palaeohydrological reconstructions as well as to address precisely the past distribution of unusual taxa.

AB Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) play a central role in the construction and maintenance of a tree's vascular system, but feedbacks between the NSC status of trees and wood formation are not fully understood. We aimed to evaluate multiple dependencies among wood anatomy, winter NSC, and phenology for coexisting temperate (Quercus robur) and sub-Mediterranean (Q. pyrenaica) oaks along a water-availability gradient in the NW Iberian Peninsula. Sapwood NSC concentrations were quantified at three sites in December 2012 (N = 240). Leaf phenology and wood anatomy were surveyed in 2013. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the interplay among hydraulic diameter (Dh), winter NSC, budburst date, and earlywood vessel production (EVP), while the effect of D-h and EVP on latewood width was assessed by using a mixed-effects model. NSC and wood production increased under drier conditions for both species. Q. robur showed a narrower Dh and lower soluble sugar (SS) concentration (3.88-5.08% dry matter) than Q. pyrenaica (4.06-5.57% dry matter), but Q. robur exhibited larger EVP and wider latewood (1403 mu m) than Q. pyrenaica (667 mu m). Stem diameter and D-h had a positive effect on SS concentrations, which were related to an earlier leaf flushing in both species. Sapwood sugar content appeared to limit EVP exclusively in Q. pyrenaica. In turn, D-h and EVP were found to be key predictors of latewood growth. Our results confirm that sapwood SS concentrations are involved in modulating growth resumption and xylem production in spring. Q. pyrenaica exhibited a tighter control of carbohydrate allocation to wood formation than Q. robur, which would play a role in protecting against environmental stress in the sub-Mediterranean area.

AB Prediction of future forest carbon (C) stocks as influenced by forest management and climate is a crucial issue in the search for strategies to mitigate and adapt to global change. It is hard to quantify the long-term effect of specific forest practices on C stocks due to the high number of processes affected by forest management. This work aims to quantify how forest management impacts C stocks in Mediterranean mountain forests based on 25 combinations of site index, tree species composition and thinning intensity in three different climate scenarios using the CO2Fix v.3.2 model Masera et al. (Ecol Modell 164:177-199, 2003). The study area is an ecotonal zone located in Central Spain, and the tree species are Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.). Our results show a strong effect of tree species composition and a negligible effect of thinning intensity. Mixed stands have the highest total stand C stocks: 100 % and 15 % more than pure oak and pine stands respectively, and are here suggested as a feasible and effective mitigation option. Climate change induced a net C loss compared to control scenarios, when reduction in tree growth is taken into account. Mixed stands showed the lowest reduction in forest C stocks due to climate change, indicating that mixed stands are also a valid adaptation strategy. Thus converting from pure to mixed forests would enhance C sequestration under both current and future climate conditions.

AB Land use change and global warming are important drivers in the distribution of tree species. The Mediterranean mountain forest ecosystems can be severely affected by climate change since an increment in temperature has been observed. The main aim of this work was to analyze shifts in the distribution and changes in the abundance of Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Mediterranean mountains over a period of 47 years (1965-2012) by using data from the National Forest Inventories, extending the Universal Kriging/Cokriging models to the space-time case for long-term forest inventory data analysis including climatic variables. Our results indicated that both the distribution and the abundance of Scots pine remained quite constant during the study period. Pyrenean oak increased its presence by 42% whereas its abundance doubled between 1965 and 2012. This movement took place towards both higher and lower altitudes. With regard to climatic factors, the kriging models showed a negative association between the presence of Scots pine and the temperature. However, we found a quadratic relationship between the Pyrenean oak and temperature, pointing to the occurrence of at intermediate altitudes. Additionally, we found significant relationships between the rainfall and the abundance of both species. Rainfall was positively related to the abundance of Scots pine and negatively to that of Pyrenean oak. Our results indicate that there has been a threefold increase in the area covered by mixed stands. However, successive land use changes as well as forest policies related to conservation have played an important role in the distribution of both species and therefore are taken into account in the discussion of these results.

AB The characterization of suitable microsites for tree seedling establishment and growth is one of the most important tasks to achieve the restoration of native forest using natural processes in disturbed sites. For that, we assessed the natural Quercus petraea forest expansion in a 20-year-old reclaimed open-cast mine under sub-Mediterranean climate in northern Spain, monitoring seedling survival, growth, and recruitment during 5 years in three contrasting environments (undisturbed forest, mine edge, and mine center). Seedling density and proportion of dead branches decreased greatly from undisturbed forest towards the center of the mine. There was a positive effect of shrubs on Q. petraea seedling establishment in both mine environments, which increase as the environment undergoes more stress (from the mine edge to the center of the mine), and it was produced by different shrub structural features in each mine environment. Seedling survival reduction through time in three environments did not lead to a density reduction because there was a yearly recruitment of new seedlings. Seedling survival, annual growth, and height through time were greater in mine sites than in the undisturbed forest. The successful colonization patterns and positive neighbor effect of shrubs on natural seedlings establishment found in this study during the first years support the use of shrubs as ecosystem engineers to increase heterogeneity in micro-environmental conditions on reclaimed mine sites, which improves late-successional Quercus species establishment.

AB Low-latitudinal range margins of temperate and boreal plant species typically consist of scattered populations that persist locally in microrefugia. It remains poorly understood how their refugial habitats affect patterns of gene flow and connectivity, key components for their long-term viability and evolution. We examine landscape-scale patterns of historical and contemporary gene flow in refugial populations of the widespread European forest tree Pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) at the species' southwestern range margin. We sampled all adult trees (n = 135) growing in a 20 km long valley and genotyped 724 acorns from 72 mother trees at 17 microsatellite loci. The ten oak stands that we identified were highly differentiated and formed four distinct genetic clusters, despite sporadic historical dispersal being detectable. By far most contemporary pollination occurred within stands, either between local mates (85.6%) or through selfing (6.8%). Pollen exchange between stands (2.6%) was remarkably rare given their relative proximity and was complemented by long-distance pollen immigration (4.4%) and hybridization with the locally abundant Quercus pyrenaica (0.6%). The frequency of between-stand mating events decreased with increasing size and spatial isolation of stands. Overall, our results reveal outstandingly little long-distance gene flow for a wind-pollinated tree species. We argue that the distinct landscape characteristics of oaks' refugial habitats, with a combination of a rugged topography, dense vegetation and humid microclimate, are likely to increase plant survival but to hamper effective long-distance pollen dispersal. Moreover, local mating might be favoured by high tree compatibility resulting from genetic purging in these long-term relict populations.

AB The knowledge of the distributional patterns of saproxylic beetles is essential for conservation biology due to the relevance of this fauna in the maintenance of ecological processes and the endangerment of species. The complex community of saproxylic beetles is shaped by different assemblages that are composed of species linked by the microhabitats they use. We evaluate how different the species distribution patterns that are obtained can be, depending on the analyzed assemblage and to what extent these can affect conservation decisions. Beetles were sampled using hollow emergence and window traps in three protected areas of the Iberian Peninsula. Species richness, composition, and diversity turnover were analyzed for each sampling method and showed high variation depending on the analyzed assemblage. Beta diversity was clearly higher among forests for the assemblage captured using window traps. This method collects flying insects from different tree microhabitats and its captures are influenced by the forest structuring. Within forests, the assemblages captured by hollow emergence traps, which collect the fauna linked to tree hollows, showed the largest turnover of species, as they are influenced by the characteristics of each cavity. Moreover, the selection of the forest showing the highest species richness strongly depended on the studied assemblage. This study demonstrates that differences in the studied assemblages (group of species co-occurring in the same habitat) can also lead to significant differences in the identified patterns of species distribution and diversity turnover. This fact will be necessary to take into consideration when making decisions about conservation and management.

AB 1. Climate change scenarios forecast rising temperatures for the Mediterranean region, which could enhance the vulnerability to drought stress in forest ecosystems. The long-term effects of climate forcing on tree performance can be, however, modulated by other environmental factors, such as competition and rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
   2. We assessed the concomitant effect of competition, climate and CO2 concentrations on the treering delta C-13-derived intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) and basal area increments (BAI) of species with different drought tolerance: two Mediterranean deciduous species (Quercus faginea Lam. and Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) and one conifer (Pinus sylvestris L.). Additionally, given that competition may be managed to mitigate the effect of increasing drought stress, we further examined the influence of this variable on iWUE and growth using data compiled from the literature, providing the first review on the response of iWUE to competition.
   3. Competition had no significant effect on iWUE in any of the three species studied, whereas, as expected, growth rates were significantly higher under low-competition levels. This was consistent with the literature review, which showed that shifts in iWUE with competition changes are rare; supporting the hypothesis that leaf-level gas exchange tends to be a homeostatic trait. In the long term, the three species exhibited a significant increasing trend in iWUE due to the combined effect of increased CO2 concentration, climate and age. Growth, however, was mostly affected by competition and climate and in most cases was not enhanced as a result of the increase in iWUE.
   4. Synthesis. Regardless of their functional response to drought, trees respond to reduced competition through the structural shifts such as increased radial growth rather than leaf-level gas exchange adjustments. CO2 and climate are, therefore, the main drivers of iWUE variability, rather than competition. Thus, if temperature-induced drought becomes limiting, reducing competition for resources may not offset the detrimental effect of increasing drought stress on tree physiology and growth decline may occur without a CO2 fertilization effect.

AB Since a substantial portion of respired CO2 remains within the stem, diel and seasonal trends in stem CO2 concentration ([CO2]) are of major interest in plant respiration and carbon budget research. However, continuous long-term stem [CO2] studies are scarce, and generally absent in Mediterranean climates. In this study, stem [CO2] was monitored every 15min together with stem and air temperature, sap flow, and soil water storage during a growing season in 16 stems of Quercus pyrenaica to elucidate the main drivers of stem [CO2] at different temporal scales. Fluctuations in sap pH were also assessed during two growing seasons to evaluate potential errors in estimates of the concentration of CO2 dissolved in xylem sap ([CO2*]) calculated using Henry's law. Stem temperature was the best predictor of stem [CO2] and explained more than 90% and 50% of the variability in stem [CO2] at diel and seasonal scales, respectively. Under dry conditions, soil water storage was the main driver of stem [CO2]. Likewise, the first rains after summer drought caused intense stem [CO2] pulses, suggesting enhanced stem and root respiration and increased resistance to radial CO2 diffusion. Sap flow played a secondary role in controlling stem [CO2] variations. We observed night-time sap pH acidification and progressive seasonal alkalinization. Thus, if the annual mean value of sap pH (measured at midday) was assumed to be constant, night-time sap [CO2*] was substantially overestimated (40%), and spring and autumn sap [CO2*] were misestimated by 25%. This work highlights that diel and seasonal variations in temperature, tree water availability, and sap pH substantially affect xylem [CO2] and sap [CO2*].

AB The species richness of epiphytic lichens is continuously decreasing by degradation and loss of habitat. Considering that taxonomic identification of all species is time and resource consuming, rapid assessment methods to extrapolate the total number of species are needed for practical conservation. This paper describes an alternative method using the correlation between lichens growth forms and species richness. The study was conducted in 406 forest stands located in Central Spain, covering a wide range of mediterranean-climate ecosystem regions, management intensity levels, canopy cover conditions, and tree sizes. The presence/absence of epiphytic lichens was determined in 6090 trees, which were dominated by oak species (Quercus ilex, Q, faginea, and Q. pyrenaica). In all type of forests, the diversity of growth forms was positively correlated with the total epiphytic lichen richness. In all cases, species richness increased in non-managed forest stands with dense canopies. Thus, we propose the use of lichen growth forms as a helpful surrogate of species richness to detect potentially conservation priority areas in the Mediterranean region. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Slow growth, branch dieback and scarce acorn yield are visible symptoms of decay in abandoned Quercus pyrenaica coppices. A hypothetical root-to-shoot (R:S) imbalance provoked by historical coppicing is investigated as the underlying driver of stand degradation. After stem genotyping, 12 stems belonging to two clones covering 81 and 16 m2 were harvested and excavated to measure above- and below ground biomass and nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) pools. To study root system functionality, root connections and root longevity were assessed by radiocarbon analysis. Seasonality of NSC was monitored on five additional clones. NSC pools, R:S biomass ratio and fine roots-to-foliage ratio were higher in the large clone, whose centennial root system, estimated to be 550 years old, maintained large amounts of sapwood (51.8%) for NSC storage. 248 root connections were observed within the large clone, whereas the small clone showed comparatively simpler root structure (26 connections). NSC concentrations were higher in spring (before bud burst) and autumn (before leaf fall), and lower in summer (after complete leaf expansion); they were always higher in roots than in stems or twigs. The persistence of massive and highly inter-connected root systems after coppicing may lead to increasing R:S biomass ratios and root NSC pools over time. We highlight the need of surveying belowground organs to understand aboveground dynamics of Q. pyrenaica, and suggest that enhanced belowground NSC storage and consumption reflect a trade-off between clonal vegetative resilience and aboveground performance.

AB World forests are undergoing contrasted trends. While in some areas pressures continue, in others these are decreasing, setting forests into a trajectory of recovery. However, disturbances can interact with this process, inducing shifts toward alternative states. Here we investigated the post-fire recovery of an ancient Pious pinaster forest with Quercus pyrenaica in the understory in Central Spain, in which intensive management had decreased. Post-fire forest recovery was sampled and stand history was characterized using forest planning records. Stand history, structure and other geophysical data, including fire severity, were utilized as predictors, as appropriate, of pre-fire stand structure and of the post-fire forest using boosted regression trees. We found that pre-fire Quercus stem density tended to be higher in stands without recent management plans, although overall stand structure was poorly predictable. The post fire forest was dominated by Pinus, Quercus, or a mixture of both. Pinus density was mostly unpredictable, while Quercus abundance was highly dependent on its pre-fire stem density: In stands with over 200 Quercus stems per hectare, the post-fire forest was dominated by Quercus. Therefore, fire mediated a forest shift from Pinus to Quercus, driven by the pre-fire colonization of Quercus in the understory in areas with a longer time without management plans. Arguably, in case of recurrent fire, shifts will continue occurring where Pinus is still dominant. However, in the longer term, Quercus persistence in the area is threatened by climate change, since the climate space will be drastically reduced for Quercus, not for Pinus. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Height-diameter relationships are used in order to make forest inventories less expensive and to assess growth and yield. This study aimed to develop height-diameter models for individual trees of Araucaria angustifolia (Bertol.) Kuntze for different locations and growth conditions in Southern Brazil. Our data include locations of at least one third of this species natural geographical distribution. We used Michailoff's model, and compared height-diameter tendency through analytical methods. The model showed good overall precision and accuracy. Trees growing in forest conditions had a higher asymptotic height, and reached it at smaller diameters than open-grown trees. Different regions had contrasting height-diameter tendency indicating site potential, especially for natural forests. Individual tree asymptotic height was correlated with site altitude and mean annual precipitation. This study represents a source of parameters for height-diameter relationships in a large geographical span, for a species with high cultural and timber value in Southern Brazil.

AB The current study about physical properties of wood of Quercus robur L., Q. petraea (Matt.) Liebl., and Q. pyrenaica Willd. in Galicia (northwest of Spain) was based on the determination of proportion of sapwood, heartwood, infradensity, and porosity to understand and estimate the variation of these characteristics and/or properties in the Galician oaks. For this, it was necessary to fell several trees within the study area. In total, 45 trees were chosen in 15 different stands of provinces of Lugo and Ourense, i.e., we have obtained 45 wood slices of Quercus at 60 cm tall on the trunk of the tree, and 194 wood samples with a parallelepiped shape and dimensions of 2x2x4 cm +/- 1 mm.
   The infradensity characterization reveals that oak wood from Galicia has a greater infradensity than French oaks, and Quercus pyrenaica has a higher infradensity than Q. robur and Q. petraea. There is a strong variation of the same based on the geographic origin, but there is almost no variation inside a plot.
   The global objective was to realize a detailed description on the physical properties of wood of these species for its possible use in industry cooperage. For this, the objective of this initial work was to begin with the study of wood infradensity.

AB Deciduous forests occur widely in central-western Europe as far south as the Iberian Peninsula. In this area dominated by a Mediterranean-type climate, the marcescent endemic Quercus pyrenaica Willd. serves as an indicator of the southern limit of broad-leaved forests. Its distribution area extends from southwest France to northeast Morocco, occupying-at least potentially-large areas of the peninsula and thus covering a wide variety of environments and ecological niches that we will attempt to identify. Different community types will also be identified, based on current classifications and the latest analysis of these forests. Their uniqueness, the current situation of global change, and real threats to their conservation and existence, have made their study a pressing concern.

AB Deciduous oak coppices (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) of the "Sierra de Gata" mountains (central western Spain) are located on acid rocks and subjected to annual rainfall higher than 700 mm year(-1). Accordingly, the soils are acidic (soil pH is often below 5.0) and feature the presence of Mn2+ and Al3+ in the exchangeable complex. The aim of the present study was to assess the response of these soils to the addition of a lime residue from a sugar beet mill to reach pH values close to 7.0 and 6.0 with in situ and in vitro experiments, respectively. Initially, the quality of the lime by-product was evaluated, which showed content close to 75 % CaCO3. Based on that analysis, calculations were accomplished to determine the dose of lime by-product necessary for achieving the targeted soil pH. We first performed an in vitro liming experiment, incubating 0.50 kg soil (0-20 cm layer) with 23.92 g CaCO3 kg(-1) soil (20 degrees C and soil moisture equivalent to that of field capacity). Subsequently, another experiment was done adding an equivalent quantity of sub-product in lieu of the pure CaCO3; the factors monitored were: soil pH, exchange acidity, CEC, and exchangeable bases, every 24 h. The in situ experiment was performed in a forest plot located in Western Spain (Navasfrias), liming with 16.0 Mg DM by-product ha(-1) (September 1999). Soil samples (two depths: 0-10 and 10-20 cm) were taken from both the control and the experimental forest plots for monitoring the liming effect. Sampling dates were September and December 1999; June 2000, January, June and September 2001; October 2002 and 2003, and March 2005). The dissolution of the lime by-product at the laboratory was almost immediate, but the effects in the field occurred approximately 2 years after initial liming, since lime dissolution depends on both the amount and distribution of rainfall and, also, on the application procedure.

AB This study aimed to develop ALS-based models for estimating stem, crown and aboveground biomass in three types of Mediterranean forest, based on low density ALS data. Two different modelling approaches were used: (i) linear models with different variable selection methods (Stepwise Selection [SS], Clustering/Exhaustive search [CE] and Genetic Algorithm [GA]), and (ii) previously Published Models (PM) applicable to diverse types of forest. Results indicated more accurate estimations of biomass components for pure Pinus pinea L. (rRMSE = 25.90-26.16%) than for the mixed (30.86-36.34%) and Quercus pyrenaica Willd. forests (32.78-34.84%). All the tested approaches were valuable, but SS and GA performed better than CE and PM in most cases.

AB Aim of study: The aim of the study was to determine the baseline carbon stock in forest floor and mineral soils in pine and oak stands in acid soils in Northern Spain.
   Area of study: The study area is situated in northern Spain (42 degrees N, 4 degrees W) on "Paramos y Valles" region of Palencia.
   Material and methods: An extensive monitoring composed of 48 plots (31 in pine and 17 in oak stands) was carried out. Litter layers and mineral soil samples, at depths of 0-30 cm and 30-60 cm, were taken in each plot. An intensive monitoring was also performed by sampling 12 of these 48 plots selected taken in account species forest composition and their stand development stage. Microbial biomass C (C-MB), C mineralization (C-RB), and soil organic C balance at stand level were determined in surface soil samples of intensive monitoring.
   Main results: No differences in soil C content were detected in the two forest ecosystems up to 60 cm depth (53.0 +/- 25.8 Mg C ha(-1) in Pinus spp. plantations and 60.3 +/- 43.8 Mg C ha(-1) in oak stands). However, differences in total C (C-T), C-MB and C-RB were found in the upper 10 cm of the soils depending on the stand development stage in each species forest composition (Pinus nigra, Pinus pinaster, Pinus sylvestris and Quercus pyrenaica). Plots with high development stage exhibited significant lower metabolic quotient (qCO(2)), so, meant more efficient utilization of C by the microbial community. The C content in the forest floor was higher in pine stands (13.7 +/- 0.9 Mg C ha(-1)) than in oak stands (5.4 +/- 0.7 Mg C ha(-1)). A greater turnover time was found in pine ecosystems vs. oak stands. In contrast, forest floor H layer was nonexistent in oak stands.
   Research highlights: Results about litterfall, forest floor and mineral soil dynamics in this paper can be used strategically to reach environmental goals in new afforestation programs and sustainable forest management approaches.

AB This study addresses relationships between leaf phenology, xylogenesis, and functional xylem anatomy in two ring-porous oak species, the temperate Quercus robur and the sub-Mediterranean Q. pyrenaica.
   Earlywood vessel (EV) formation and leaf phenology were monitored in 2012 and 2013. Ten individuals per species were sampled at each of three sites located in NW Iberian Peninsula. EV areas measured on microcore sections were used to calculate the hydraulic tree diameter (D-h), in order to model relationships to phenology. Thermal requirements were evaluated using growing degree days (GDD).
   A species-specific timing of growth resumption was found. The onset of EV formation and budburst were associated to a particular GDD in each species. The onset and duration of EV enlargement affected Dh (and EV size) in Q. robur, but hardly in Q. pyrenaica.
   The relationship between the timings of EV formation and xylem structure appears to be stronger for the temperate oak, whose larger vessels may result from thermal-induced earlier resumption. In contrast, the sub-Mediterranean oak would maintain a more conservative hydraulic architecture under warming conditions.

AB Xylem and soil CO (2) fluxes in coppiced oak forests increase with clonal size, suggesting larger expenditures of energy for root respiration. An imbalance between root demand and shoot production of carbohydrates may contribute to the degradation of abandoned coppices.
   Our understanding of root respiration is limited, particularly in root-resprouting species with many stems and a large system of interconnected roots resulting from long-term coppicing.
   We tested the hypothesis that clone size influences the internal flux of CO2 dissolved in xylem sap (F (T)) from roots into the stem and soil CO2 efflux (F (S)) as indicators of root respiration. We predicted that large clones would exhibit higher F (T) per stem and F (S) than small clones due to larger root system per stem in large clones.
   Genetic analyses were performed to elucidate clonal grouping. F (T) was measured continuously for 100 days in 16 similar-sized stems of Quercus pyrenaica belonging to two large and two small clones. F (S) was measured in 20 clones of varying size.
   F (T) per stem and F (S) were higher in large clones. F (T) was 2 % of the root-respired CO2 that diffused through soil to the atmosphere.
   Relative to other studies, the contribution of F (T) to root respiration was very low, pointing to large differences depending on species or site. Higher stem F (T) and F (S) in large clones compared with small clones suggest greater carbon consumption by roots in large clones, pointing to a root/shoot biomass and physiological imbalance resulting from long-term coppicing that would partially explain the degradation of currently abandoned stands of Q. pyrenaica.

AB Reforestation is common to restore degraded ecosystems, but tree-species choice often neglects ongoing environmental changes. We evaluated the performance of planted seedlings of two oak species at two sites in a Mediterranean mountain (Sierra Nevada, SE Spain): one located within the current altitudinal forest range (1,600-1,760 m), and one above the upper forest limit (1,970-2,120 m). The forest service planted 1,350 seedlings of the deciduous Pyrenean oak and the evergreen Holm oak in a postfire successional shrubland. After 2 years, seedlings were monitored for survival, and a subset of 110 Pyrenean oaks and 185 Holm oaks were harvested for analyses of biomass and foliar nutrient status, C-13, and O-18. Both species showed the highest survival and leaf N status above the upper forest limit, and survival increased with altitude within each plot. The deciduous oak benefited most from planting at higher altitude, and it also had greater biomass at the higher site. Correlations between foliar N, O-18, and C-13 across elevations indicate tighter stomatal control of water loss and greater water-use efficiency with increasing plant N status at higher altitude, which may represent a so-far overlooked positive feedback mechanism that could foster uphill range shifts in water-limited mountain regions. Given ongoing trends and future projections of increasing temperature and aridity throughout the Mediterranean region, tree-species selection for forest restoration should target forecasted climatic conditions rather than those prevailing in the past. This study highlights that ecosystem restoration provides an opportunity to assist species range shifts under rapidly changing climate.

AB An Illumina Infinium SNP genotyping array was constructed for European white oaks. Six individuals of Quercus petraea and Q.robur were considered for SNP discovery using both previously obtained Sanger sequences across 676 gene regions (1371 in vitro SNPs) and Roche 454 technology sequences from 5112 contigs (6542 putative in silico SNPs). The 7913 SNPs were genotyped across the six parental individuals, full-sib progenies (one within each species and two interspecific crosses between Q.petraea and Q.robur) and three natural populations from south-western France that included two additional interfertile white oak species (Q.pubescens and Q.pyrenaica). The genotyping success rate in mapping populations was 80.4% overall and 72.4% for polymorphic SNPs. In natural populations, these figures were lower (54.8% and 51.9%, respectively). Illumina genotype clusters with compression (shift of clusters on the normalized x-axis) were detected in similar to 25% of the successfully genotyped SNPs and may be due to the presence of paralogues. Compressed clusters were significantly more frequent for SNPs showing a priori incorrect Illumina genotypes, suggesting that they should be considered with caution or discarded. Altogether, these results show a high experimental error rate for the Infinium array (between 15% and 20% of SNPs potentially unreliable and 10% when excluding all compressed clusters), and recommendations are proposed when applying this type of high-throughput technique. Finally, results on diversity levels and shared polymorphisms across targeted white oaks and more distant species of the Quercus genus are discussed, and perspectives for future comparative studies are proposed.

AB Logs of three common Southern and mid-European woods (Quercus pyrenaica, Populus nigra and Fagus sylvatica) were burned in two different combustion appliances, a fireplace and a stove. The flue gas composition was monitored continuously in the exhaust ducts of both burning appliances for total hydrocarbons (THC) and carbon oxides (CO2 and CO). Particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter below 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) was sampled in a dilution tunnel under isokinetic conditions and chemically characterised for water soluble-inorganic ions, organic and elemental carbon and levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan. The evolution of the emission factors of these components throughout the combustion cycle was studied. The fireplace was the combustion appliance with the highest CO, CO2, THC and PM2.5 emission factors. The carbonaceous matter represented 72-84% of the particulate mass emitted, regardless of species burned and combustion devices. OC/EC ratios were higher for the fireplace than for the stove, and showed a significant potential relation with K+/levoglucosan. The dominant water soluble inorganic ions in smoke particles were K+, PO43-, SO42-, and Na+. Anhydrosugar emissions were strongly enhanced in the start-up phase, when lower temperatures are registered, and decreased progressively until the glowing combustion phase. However, K+ emission seems to be higher in flaming-dominated combustion at higher temperature. Statistical analyses, including the Kruskal-Wallis test, principal component analysis and Pearson correlation between emission factors, were carried out. A significant correlation between NH4+ and levoglucosan was found for both appliances. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A total of 75 surface samples collected from mosses in the Quercus pyrenaica forests of the Spanish Central System mountains were analysed for their pollen content. The samples were taken from six different Quercus pyrenaica phytosociological associations between 443 and 1657 m a.s.l. and fall within distinct rainfall and temperature regimes. The aims of this paper are to provide new data on the modern pollen rain from Central Spain, and to perform these data using multivariate statistics (hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis) and pollen percentages. We could distinguish first between unaltered and disturbed forest landscapes and among different Quercus pyrenaica forest associations based on climatic gradients (rainfall pattern, summer moisture). This analysis allowed us to identify a set of pollen taxa markers which could assist in distinguishing these oak forest communities.

AB The selection of nest sites and nesting material may have important implications for avian reproductive behaviour and performance. Nest construction may involve costs arising from transporting material that may be reduced considerably if nest materials are located close to the nest site. Eurasian Nuthatch Sitta europaea nests in our nest box study area are mainly composed of pine bark flakes or alternatively of strips of bark of the widespread shrub Cistus laurifolius, with variable amounts of mud being used for plastering the entrance. Several small streams run through the area - an oak Quercus pyrenaica forest with a few scattered pines Pinus sylvestris. Here we show that Nuthatches collected pine bark only when nest sites were situated close to pines, used more mud when breeding close to streams and selected nest sites closer to streams than a sympatric species not using mud, the Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca. Nuthatches used pine bark only when there was a pine tree less than 100 m away from the nest box and selected Cistus bark when transport distance was greater. We suggest that the selection of nest sites and nest materials in this species may be constrained by the costs of transporting nest material.

AB We analysed climate-growth relationships for two ring-porous oak species (Quercus robur L. and Q. pyrenaica Willd.) at one site in northwestern Spain. Increment cores from 12 living trees per species were taken for ring and earlywood vessel measurements, considering three width variables (for earlywood, latewood, and the whole ring) and six anatomical variables (based on vessel area distribution, number of vessels, and conductivity) in the earlywood. We used standard dendrochronological procedures and compared each mean series with meteorological records of temperature, precipitation, and estimates of soil water content. Earlywood width was negatively related to precipitation in the previous late season for Q. robur, but it was controlled by the previous spring temperature for Q. pyrenaica. These responses were highly dependent on vessel number and probably related to carbohydrate storage dynamics but differed between species. Vessel size showed a stronger relationship to climate and was mainly coupled to water excess during the winter for Q. robur but dependent on quiescence temperature for Q. pyrenaica; also, climatic signal in vessel size was maximized by the largest vessels for Q. pyrenaica but only increased slightly for Q. robur. Consequently, vessel parameters showed a much stronger climate signal than ring width and were successful at highlighting the differences between both oak species.

AB A drier climate together with intense management can be detrimental for species when they are found at their xeric limit. We analyzed the dynamics of Pinus sylvestris in Central Spain in relation to colonization by more drought-tolerant Quercus pyrenaica. The studied forest presents high biodiversity and is one of the last stands relict from a widespread pine-dominated forest in West-Central Iberian Mountains demised by human deforestation. The observed age patterns could suggest a natural regeneration origin of the current stand for both species. However, while oaks regenerated continuously since the 1950s, there was almost no pine regeneration after the 1870s. Therefore, the lack of pine regeneration was previous to recent climatic changes. Pine stands with ongoing oak colonization were likely thinned in the 1920s in opposition to pure pine stands. Mixed and pure stands expressed certain differences in their response to climate. Pines suffered more from high temperatures from spring to fall, which would reflect their lower tolerance to drought than oaks. Cross-wavelet analysis showed that pine exhibited an increase in their sensitivity to drought intensity in the last years. However, the dominant pine canopy established in the nineteenth century does not show symptoms of growth decline in response to climate change. The factors determining the disruption of pine regeneration need to be determined. Management could have played a dominant role constraining stand dynamics, threatening pine sustainability through modifications of the understory vegetation and soil properties.

AB In the Mediterranean region, over the past few centuries human activity has modeled the landscape, leading to forest degradation. However, as in many parts of the European continent since the second half of the twentieth century, the Iberian Peninsula has been subject to a substantial degree of land abandonment that has led to the expansion of important secondary forests. One of the dominant tree species in the transitional forests of mountain areas between the Mediterranean and Euro-Siberian regions of the Iberian Peninsula is the deciduous oak, Quercus pyrenaica Willd. The main objectives of the present work were to study the mode of regeneration and forest dynamics of Q. pyrenaica in several types of stands: young forests, mature and previously perturbed forests, and abandoned Pinus reforestations. With this in mind we established eight plots in the mountain range of the Sierra de Francia-Quilamas, in the west subdivision of the Spanish Central System. We analyzed the age and dbh distributions, regeneration density, and the spatial structure of trees and saplings. Young Q. pyrenaica stands were seen to show episodic recruitment after land abandonment consistent with a 'catastrophic' mode of regeneration. These stands were characterized by unimodal age-cohorts, with tree recruitment dropping drastically as the canopy developed and closed in, except at some study sites where the more shade-tolerant Castanea sativa was found. Older and previously disturbed Q, pyrenaica stands showed bimodal age cohorts, the young ones exhibiting a clumped pattern associated with canopy gaps and/or a lower tree density of the older cohort. In abandoned Pinus reforestations, the recruitment of Q pyrenaica was also associated with canopy openings. These findings show that Q pyrenica also undergoes a gap-phase mode of regeneration. An abundant regeneration of Q pyrenaica could be found at all the stands, guaranteeing the persistence of seedling banks (but a scarcity or lack of saplings) under closed forests, until canopy gaps may allow some Q pyrenaica individuals to grow and reach the main canopy.

AB The implementation of the Natura 2000 network requires methods to assess the conservation status of habitats. This paper shows a methodological approach that combines the use of (satellite) Earth observation with ontologies to monitor Natura 2000 habitats and assess their functioning. We have created an ontological system called Savia that can describe both the ecosystem functioning and the behaviour of abiotic factors in a Natura 2000 habitat. This system is able to automatically download images from MODIS products, create indicators and compute temporal trends for them. We have developed an ontology that takes into account the different concepts and relations about indicators and temporal trends, and the spatio-temporal components of the datasets. All the information generated from datasets and MODIS images, is stored into a knowledge base according to the ontology. Users can formulate complex questions using a SPARQL end-point. This system has been tested and validated in a case study that uses Quercus pyrenaica Willd. forests as a target habitat in Sierra Nevada (Spain), a Natura 2000 site. We assess ecosystem functioning using NDVI. The selected abiotic factor is snow cover. Savia provides useful data regarding these two variables and reflects relationships between them.

AB Studies about the productivity of forest ecosystems help to quantify sequestered carbon and provide data that are used in forest management. Forests in northern Portugal are an important economic resource, but their productivity in scenarios of future climate change is not yet well understood. The objectives of this study were to evaluate and compare simulated net primary production (NPP) and NPP based on measured data of two tree species located in the Vila Real district forests, pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton) and oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) and assess their simulated-NPP in diverse climate conditions, including future climate scenarios and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. An ecosystem process model, Biome-BGC, which simulates carbon, nitrogen and water cycles of forest ecosystems close to equilibrium conditions, was used to examine the importance of site and ecophysiological factors on the productivity of these forests. Climate change scenarios and increased CO2 concentrations were tested to explore potential responses of the studied species. The model provided good estimates of NPP. There was a strong correlation between the simulated and measured NPP values in the pine (15) and oak (15) stands. The NPP of these forests are predicted to increase in the future with a CO2 increase whereas in a climate with higher temperature and lower soil moisture, the NPP will decrease. These results confirm that precipitation is a very important climate variable to growth and productivity in the Mediterranean forest ecosystems. This study also demonstrated the ability of Biome-BGC to accurately simulate forest ecosystems behaviour and encourages the application of model simulations in Portugal.

AB We analyzed the genetic mosaic of speciation in two hybridizing Mediterranean white oaks from the Iberian Peninsula (Quercus faginea Lamb. and Quercus pyrenaica Willd.). The two species show ecological divergence in flowering phenology, leaf morphology and composition, and in their basic or acidic soil preferences. Ninety expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeats (EST-SSRs) and eight nuclear SSRs were genotyped in 96 trees from each species. Genotyping was designed in two steps. First, we used 69 markers evenly distributed over the 12 linkage groups (LGs) of the oak linkage map to confirm the species genetic identity of the sampled genotypes, and searched for differentiation outliers. Then, we genotyped 29 additional markers from the chromosome bins containing the outliers and repeated the multilocus scans. We found one or two additional outliers within four saturated bins, thus confirming that outliers are organized into clusters. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was extensive; even for loosely linked and for independent markers. Consequently, score tests for association between two-marker haplotypes and the 'species trait' showed a broad genomic divergence, although substantial variation across the genome and within LGs was also observed. We discuss the influence of several confounding effects on neutrality tests and review the evolutionary processes leading to extensive LD. Finally, we examine how LD analyses within regions that contain outlier clusters and quantitative trait loci can help to identify regions of divergence and/or genomic hitchhiking in the light of predictions from ecological speciation theory.

AB Facilitative interactions among plants enable a species persist in stressful environments, but its use as a restoration technique of plant cover in degraded man-made ecosystems requires more accuracy. Here, a two-year field experiment was conducted to determine if native colonizer shrubs (Genista florida and Cytisus scoparius) used as nurse plants enhance Quercus petraea and Quercus pyrenaica reintroduction in reclaimed open-cast coal mines in Northern Spain. Of each tree species, 400 seedlings and 940 acorns were planted under four different treatments combining the influence of nurse shrubs and herbivory/predation upon Quercus seedlings and acorns. In each experiment, acorn emergence and seedling survival and growth were monitored. Shrubs enhanced seedling survival and growth and acorn emergence, in comparison with open spaces. Seedling survivalwas <20% in open areas and >90% under shrubs after the first summer. Acorn predation was a limitation, but not seedling herbivory. Seedling survival and growth were greater for Q. pyrenaica than Q. petraea, while Q. petraea showed better acorn emergence and survival of emerged acorns. The use of shrubs as nurse plants to improve environmental conditions is promising for the effective reintroduction of late successional species in reclaimed mined sites. The best results are obtained through Q. pyrenaica seedlings under shrubs. This avoids problems such as acorn predation and germination failure. The ontogenetic stage and the stress tolerance of the target species should be taken in consideration in order to increase the effectiveness of this restoration technique. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Understanding the influence of environmental factors on the distribution of tree species is essential for developing management actions at regional level. We developed species distribution models for six European tree species to determine their potential niche in the Spanish Atlantic region, where deciduous forests are relatively well preserved. Data from the national Forest Inventory and topo-climatic and soil variables were used to construct distribution models by using Generalized Linear Models. The main factor accounting for the current geografic distribution of the selected species were minimum winter temperature and mineral fertility of soils. Suitable habitats for Quercus petraea and F. sylvatica were mainly high-altitude areas with low minimum temperatures. In contrast, Q. robur and C. sativa were restricted to low altitudes and warmer conditions. Betula pubescens was not influenced by the elevation, probably because its adaptation to Atlantic conditions, though its distribution was associated with low fertility soils. Although the submediterranean Q. pyrenaica was positively influenced by the slope, model performance was poor for this species, possibly because of the truncated environmental range of the species in the study area. The findings suggest that temperature rather than moisture is shaping the distribution of deciduous trees at the southern limit of the Atlantic biogeographic region. Strong elevational difference between the warm coast and the cold mountains may determine the geographical disjunction between Q. robur and Q. petraea in southern Europe.

AB Plant-plant interactions influence how forests cope with climate and contribute to modulate species response to future climate scenarios. We analysed the functional relationships between growth, climate and competition for Pinus sylvestris, Quercus pyrenaica and Quercus faginea to investigate how stand competition modifies forest sensitivity to climate and simulated how annual growth rates of these species with different drought tolerance would change throughout the 21st century. Dendroecological data from stands subjected to thinning were modelled using a novel multiplicative nonlinear approach to overcome biases related to the general assumption of a linear relationship between covariates and to better mimic the biological relationships involved. Growth always decreased exponentially with increasing competition, which explained more growth variability than climate in Q. faginea and P. sylvestris. The effect of precipitation was asymptotic in all cases, while the relationship between growth and temperature reached an optimum after which growth declined with warmer temperatures. Our growth projections indicate that the less drought-tolerant P. sylvestris would be more negatively affected by climate change than the studied sub-Mediterranean oaks. Q. faginea and P. sylvestris mean growth would decrease under all the climate change scenarios assessed. However, P. sylvestris growth would decline regardless of the competition level, whereas this decrease would be offset by reduced competition in Q. faginea. Conversely, Q. pyrenaica growth would remain similar to current rates, except for the warmest scenario. Our models shed light on the nature of the species-specific interaction between climate and competition and yield important implications for management. Assuming that individual growth is directly related to tree performance, trees under low competition would better withstand the warmer conditions predicted under climate change scenarios but in a variable manner depending on the species. Thinning following an exponential rule may be desirable to ensure long-term conservation of high-density Mediterranean woodlands, particularly in drought-limited sites.

AB Tree-ring studies have been used for over fifty years to date and quantify past flood events. Stable C and O isotopes in tree-rings have also been extensively applied to the reconstruction of past environmental conditions and their changes over time. However, the two approaches have not previously been combined. In this study we explore whether the meteorological origin of precipitation causing past flood events might be assessed by investigating oxygen stable isotopes in tree rings. It is well known that floods may have different origins, e.g. heavy convective rainstorms, frontal precipitation, snow melting, etc.; each of these floodwater sources bears a particular isotopic fingerprint.
   This paper presents the first results of this methodology applied to a recent flash flood event occurring in Central Spain. For this purpose, a well-known heavy-rain convective event was chosen from the recent flood record. In the forested area affected by this event, six cores from each of four selected species (Pinu.s. sylvestris L., Pious pinaster Ail., Quercus pyrenaica Willd. and Ants glzainosa (L)Gaertn), were sampled using an incremental borer. After a-cellulose extraction, the oxygen-isotope composition (delta O-18) in tree-rings was analyzed and compared with climate data and delta O-18 values in precipitation. The isotope signal in tree-ring cellulose was dominated by spring climatic conditions but, after removing this "spring signal", a clear and site-specific signal in latewood delta O-18 emerged, which was associated with the heavy-rain event. These preliminary results encourage more in-depth analyses aimed at recognizing specific precipitation sources and separating different populations of past floods according to their cause.

AB Identifying what factors control fire severity in large fires is critical for understanding fire impacts and planning pre- and post-fire management. Here, we determined the role of pre-fire stand structure, directional topography, and burning conditions on fire severity in a large fire (12,697 ha) in Central Spain that burned a Pinus pinaster forest on July 2005. Fire severity was estimated using RdNBR based on Landsat 5 TM images. Forest stand structure was reconstructed by systematically sampling the burned area (n = 236). Burning conditions were established using weather information and a map of fire progression, based on which fire rate of spread and propagation direction were calculated. Topographic features in the direction of the fire-front were derived from a digital elevation model. Boosted regression tree (BRT) analysis was employed to relate each group of variables or the entire set to RdNBR. Fire severity was best explained by burning conditions (cross-validation correlation [CVC] 0.56), followed by pre-fire stand structure (CVC 0.34), and directional topography (CVC 0.17). Combining the three sets of variables, CVC increased to 0.71. Higher fire severity occurred in areas burning upslope, with high fire rate of spread, with heterogeneous and dense stands of P. pinaster and Quercus pyrenaica in the understory, receiving high solar radiation, among other characteristics. Fire severity was the result of interactive relationships between burning conditions, pre-fire stand structure, and directional topography. Thus, determining factors controlling fire severity from static stand structure or topography, as is often done, may not be appropriate.

The results of this study confirm the persistence of a rich traditional knowledge in Spanish rural communities; a type of knowledge that affords abundant data for improving and adapting modern production activities to a sustainable model of development, above all as regards the rational consumption of raw materials.

AB In this data paper, we describe the dataset of the Global Change, Altitudinal Range Shift and Colonization of Degraded Habitats in Mediterranean Mountains (MIGRAME) project, which aims to assess the capacity of altitudinal migration and colonization of marginal habitats by Quercus pyrenaica Willd. forests in Sierra Nevada (southern Spain) considering two global-change drivers: temperature increase and land-use changes. The dataset includes information of the forest structure (diameter size, tree height, and abundance) of the Quercus pyrenaica ecosystem in Sierra Nevada obtained from 199 transects sampled at the treeline ecotone, mature forest, and marginal habitats (abandoned cropland and pine plantations). A total of 3839 occurrence records were collected and 5751 measurements recorded. The dataset is included in the Sierra Nevada Global-Change Observatory (OBSNEV), a long-term research project designed to compile socio-ecological information on the major ecosystem types in order to identify the impacts of global change in this mountain range.

AB Incomplete reproductive barriers between species, especially in sympatric areas where several species coexist, may result in hybridization and an increase in genetic diversity. Here we assessed the amount of genetic diversity in a community of three interfertile and sympatric European oaks (Quercus frainetto Ten., Q. petraea Liebl. Matt. and Q. pubescens Willd.) situated in central Italy. We used 11 micro satellite markers derived from Expressed Sequence Tag (EST-SSRs) and we implemented a Bayesian clustering analysis to assign individuals to species or hybrids. All genotyped loci were polymorphic for all the species and three genetic clusters corresponding to each species were detected. Significant differences and a higher level of gene flow were observed between the three oak species. Occurrence of hybrids varied markedly within the studied area: hybrids between Q. petraea and Q, pubescens were the most frequent, while hybrids between Q. petraea and Q. frainetto were particularly rare. Q. pubescens and Q. petraea showed the highest number of alleles compared to Q. frainetto, which was characterized by a low number of private, but highly frequent, alleles. However, Q. frainetto showed a lower genetic diversity and a stronger reproductive isolation from the other two oak species.

AB The present work reports a first attempt to assemble long tree-ring chronologies from Portugal potentially useful for climate reconstructions. Three oak species (Quercus pyrenaica, Quercus faginea, and Quercus ilex) were sampled at three sites in southern Portugal to obtain tree-ring chronologies. The longest tree ring series covers 173 years extending back to 1840. Our tree-ring records show, depending on the site, moderate-to-high correlations with precipitation in different seasons (from r = 0.40, p < 0.01, to 0.81, p < 0.001) and temporal stability in the growth/climate relationship for two sites. Calibration-verification trials confirm the reliability of climate/growth models for climatic reconstructions back to periods represented by tree-ring records from these two sites. Regional precipitation for Alentejo can be estimated for the following seasons: April through August (calibration r(2) = 0.24); September, from previous year, to July (calibration r(2) = 0.65). The results are a promising kick-off for Portuguese dendroclimatology, since they represent a significant breakthrough in the Mediterranean region, especially for Iberian Peninsula, where there is a considerable lack of dendroclimatic reconstructions, Further efforts to extend the tree-ring records back in time using subfossil material should be undertaken.

AB Forest fires generate large amounts of ash and biochar, or black carbon (BC), that cover the soil surface, interacting with the soil's constituents and its seedbank. This study concerns reproductive ecology assessments supported by molecular characterisation to improve our understanding of the effects of fire and fire residues on the germination behaviour of 12 arboreal species with a wide geographic distribution. For this purpose, we analysed the effects of three ash and one BC concentration on the germination of Acacia dealbata Link, A. longifolia (Andrews) Willd., A. mearnsii De Wild., A. melanoxylon R. Br., Pinus nigra Arnold, P. pinaster Aiton, P. radiata D. Don, P. sylvestris L., Quercus ilex L., Q. pyrenaica Willd., Q. robur L., and Q. rubra L. Each tree species was exposed to ash and BC created from its foliage or twigs (except for Q. rubra, which was exposed to ash and BC of Ulex europaeus L.). We monitored germination percentage, the T-50 parameter, and tracked the development of germination over time (up to 1 yr). The BC of A. dealbata, P. pinaster, and Q. robur was analysed by pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrome- try (PY-GC-MS) to assess the molecular composition. In six species, ash inhibited the germination, while in another five species, germination was not affected by ash or by BC. In Q. rubra, ash and BC stimulated its germination. This stimulating effect of the BC on Q. rubra is likely to be related to the chemical composition of the ash and BC obtained from Ulex feedstock. The BC of U. europaeus has a very different molecular composition than the other BC samples analysed, which, together with other factors, probably allowed for its germination stimulating effects.

AB Consumers are exhibiting increasing interest in honeydew honey, principally due to its functional properties. Some plants can be sources of honeydew honey, but in north-western Spain, this honey type only comes from Quercus pyrenaica. In the present study, the melissopalynological and physicochemical characteristics and the antioxidant properties of 32 honeydew honey samples are described. Q. pyrenaica honeydew honey was defined by its colour, high pH, phenols and flavonoids. Multivariate statistical techniques were used to analyse the influence of the production year on the honey's physicochemical parameters and polyphenol content. Differences among the honey samples were found, showing that weather affected the physicochemical composition of the honey samples. Optimal conditions for oak growth favoured the production of honeydew honey. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim of study: This paper aims to characterize some soil properties within the first 25 cm of the soil profile and the herbaceous biomass in Quercus forests, and the possible relationships between soil properties and understory standing biomass.
   Area of study: Three monoespecific Quercus forests (Q. suber L., Q. ilex subsp. rotundifolia Lam. and Q. pyrenaica Willd) in NE Portugal.
   Material and methods: During 1999 and 2000 soil properties (pH-KCl, total soil nitrogen (N), soil organic carbon (SOC), C/N ratio, available phosphorus (P), and available potassium (K)) and herbaceous biomass production of three forest types: Quercus suber L., Quercus ilex subsp. rotundifolia Lam. and Quercus pyrenaica Willd were studied.
   Main results: The results showed a different pattern of soil fertility (N, SOC, P, K) in Quercus forests in NE of Portugal. The C/N ratio and the herbaceous biomass confirmed this pattern.
   Research highlights: There is a pattern of Quercus sp. distribution that correlates with different soil characteristics by soil characteristics in NE Portugal. Q. pyrenaica ecosystems were found in more favoured areas (mesic conditions); Q. rotundifolia developed in nutrient-poor soils (oligotrophic conditions); and Q. suber were found in intermediate zones.

AB Aim of study: The aim of this paper is to compare differences in growth per hectare of species in pure and mixed stands as they result from different definitions of species proportions.
   Area of study: We used the data of the Spanish National Forest Inventory for Scots pine and beech mixtures in the province of Navarra and for Scots pine and Pyrenean oak mixtures in the Central mountain range and the North Iberic mountain range.
   Material and methods: Growth models were parameterized with the species growth related to its proportion as dependent variable, and dominant height, quadratic mean diameter, density, and species proportion as independent variables. As proportions we use once proportions by basal area or by stand density index and once these proportions considering the species specific maximum densities.
   Main results: In the pine-beech mixtures, where the maximum densities do not differ very much between species, the mixing effects are very similar, independent of species proportion definitions. In the pine - oak mixture, where the maximum densities in terms of basal area are very different, the equations using the proportions calculated without reference to the maximum densities, result in a distinct overestimation of the mixing effects on growth.
   Research highlights: When comparing growth per hectare of a species in a mixed stand with that of a pure stand, the species proportion must be described as a proportion by area considering the maximum density for the given species, wrong mixing effects could be introduced by inappropriate species proportion definitions.

AB The climatic conditions predicted for the twenty-first century may aggravate the extent and impacts of plant invasions, by favouring those invaders more adapted to altered conditions or by hampering the native flora. We aim to predict the fate of native and invasive tree species in the oak forests of Northwest Spain, where the exotic invaders Acacia dealbata and Eucalyptus globulus co-occur with the natives Quercus robur and Quercus pyrenaica and the naturalized Pinus pinaster. We selected adult, dominant trees of each species, collected increment cores, measured the ring width and estimated the basal area increment (BAI, cm(2) year(-1)). Climate/growth models were built by using linear mixed-effect models, where the previous-year BAI and seasonal temperature and precipitation were the fixed factors and the individual the random factor. These models were run to project the fate of studied species in the A2 and B2 CO2 emission scenarios until 2100. The models explained over 50 % of BAI variance in all species but E. globulus, where growth probably occurs whenever a minimum environmental requirement is met. Warm autumns favoured BAI of both natives, probably due to an extension of leaf lifespan, but hampered A. dealbata and P. pinaster BAI, maybe because of water imbalance and/or the depletion of carbon reserves. The projections yielded a positive BAI trend for both Quercus along the twenty-first century, but negative for the invader A. dealbata and clearly declining for the naturalized P. pinaster. Our results disagree with previous literature pointing at climate change as a driver of invasive species' success and call for further studies regarding the effect of climate change on co-occurring natives and invaders.

AB This paper presents the history of badland generated in the Saldana region, Spain; as well as the main responses eight decades after the start of restoration - in terms of vegetation, soil and erosive processes. The restoration consisted of intense reforestation and construction of more than 100 check dams and numerous wattle fences. Presently, the dense vegetation (87% cover) contrasts markedly with the degraded landscape from the early 20th century (5% cover). The thickness of litter and the natural presence of some species (Quercus pyrenaica, Paeonia broteroi and Lactarius deliciosus) clearly indicate the recovery of the site. The development of the forest cover shows that the intervention has the potential to recover almost 90% of the area. There is also evidence of soil regeneration, although some properties (erodibility, resistance to penetration and shear-strength resistance) are not that different between the forested and degraded areas. In the restored zones, runoff is negligible, since a thick layer of moss covers the spillways of all the check dams. Erosion has almost been stopped by the effects of vegetation cover, litter and higher infiltration rates (infiltration rate in forested slopes is 43.4 times greater than in bare slopes). Sediment detachment, such as landslides, mudflows and piping, still occur, but are restricted to the degraded zones. Furthermore, even when sediments are mobilized from the upper degraded hillslopes during the larger storms events (2000-2010), check dams and the lower elevation restored forest-buffers effectively work to reduce the sediment yield into the Carrion River by almost three orders of magnitude (<10(2) mg L-1), compared with data from the 1930s and 1940s (>10(5) mg L-1).

AB The "dehesa" is a traditional Iberian agrosilvopastoral ecosystem characterized by the presence of old scattered trees that are considered as "keystone-structures", which favor the presence of a wide range of biodiversity. We show the high diversity of saproxylic beetles and syrphids (Diptera) in this ecosystem, including red-listed species. We analyzed whether saproxylic species distribution in the "dehesa" was affected by tree density per hectare, dominant tree species or vegetation coverage. Species diversity did not correlate with tree density; however, it was affected by tree species and shrub coverage but in a different way for each taxon. The highest beetle diversity was linked to Quercus pyrenaica, the most managed tree species, with eight indicator species. In contrast, Q. rotundifolia hosted more species of saproxylic syrphids. Regarding vegetation coverage, shrub coverage was the only variable that affected insect richness, again in a different way for both taxa. In contrast, beetle species composition was only affected by dominant tree species whereas syrphid species composition was not affected by tree species or shrub coverage. We concluded that the high diversity of saproxylic insects in the "dehesa" is related to its long history of agrosilvopastoral management, which has generated landscape heterogeneity and preserved old mature trees. However, the richness and composition of different taxa of insects respond in different ways to tree species and vegetation coverage. Consequently, conservation strategies should try to maintain traditional management, and different saproxylic taxa should be used to monitor the effect of management on saproxylic diversity.

AB Weevils are the most important pre-dispersal acorn predators in the Mediterranean region, where oaks often form mixed forests and different weevil species can coexist. The performance of weevil larvae depends in great extent on their feeding activities inside the infested acorns that, in turn, are known to reduce the viability of acorns. In this paper, we have analysed the interactions among the weevil community and four oak species (Quercus pyrenaica, Quercus suber, Quercus faginea and Quercus ilex) coexisting in a Mediterranean mixed-oak forest. DNA sequencing of weevil larvae revealed four different weevil species (Curculio elephas, Curculio glandium, Curculio pellitus and Curculio venosus) infesting the acorns of the four oak species. Oak species differed in acorn size, and weevil species also differed in body size. Weevil species showed some degree of specificity among the four oak species, but specificity was not related to variations in acorn size. By contrast, larval development and seedling recruitment were mostly driven by inter-specific differences in larval and acorn size. Larger seeded species suffered less seed damages by weevils (i.e. embryo predation and cotyledon consumption), thus reducing the impacts of acorn infestation in seedling emergence and seedling size. Larval development for the largest weevil species C elephas was constrained by cotyledon depletion in all acorn species. Yet, this pattern was not observed for other weevil species. Larval size of the same weevil species also varied among different oak species after controlling for the amount of cotyledon eaten by larvae, thus, variation of other acorn traits among acorn species (e.g. chemical composition) may also have consequences for the performance of weevil larvae. It is likely that other variables operating at population level, such as temporal and spatial changes in acorn production or phenological variations of weevils and oaks, are also implicated in the complex functioning of these outstanding mixed-oak forests where natural regeneration seems to be threatened.

   IMPACT; QUERCUS; PATTERNS
AB There is a need to better understand how different biotic and abiotic factors interact to determine climate change enhanced tree mortality. Here, we investigated whether rising water stress determined enhanced Pinus sylvestris L. mortality at the species low-elevation limit in Central Spain. We analyzed the factors determining the health status of pines and compared with co-occurring and more drought-tolerant Quercus pyrenaica Willd along one transect following an elevation gradient. We used ordinal logistic regression to model the susceptibility of a tree to decline in relation to variability in stand competition and individual growth-patterns. The mortality pattern differed with local site conditions. Pine growth was faster but life-span shorter at drier and warmer low-elevations than at high-elevations. However, within stands, healthy trees exhibited less abrupt growth reductions and higher growth-rates but not as a consequence of lower competition, which under present stand conditions did not seem to increase adult mortality risk. Low moisture availability reduced tree-growth and, although P. sylvestris is less tolerant to drought, Q. pyrenaica was more sensitive to year-to-year moisture variability. Previous growth of dead trees from both species declined with rising water stress after the 1970s at low-elevations, which suggests that water stress intensity limited particularly tree-growth of dead trees in the long-term. For pines, widespread symptoms of crown decline (expressed by mistletoe infestation and defoliation) were only observed at low-elevation stands where, in opposition to oaks, weakened and healthy pines also exhibited recent negative growth-trends parallel to those of dead trees. The pervasive growth decline with enhanced water stress in pines from all health status at the species sampled xeric ecotone combined with the abundant crown decline symptoms observed, suggest pine vulnerability and could portend widespread mortality at its current low-elevation limit.

AB Shrubs are important microsites that facilitate seedling performance in abiotically stressed environments. However, shrub facilitation might work differently in ecosystems with high biotic stress (e.g., ungulate-dominated environments). We wonder whether ungulates through their preferences for different shrubs affect the facilitation process of seedlings, and whether this process remains consistent across different levels of abiotic stress. We study seedling performance (survival and growth) of a Mediterranean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) in three microsites (open, preferred and non-preferred shrubs by ungulates) for two contrasting climatic environments and throughout a complete growing season (increasing abiotic stress). Overall, there was a positive effect of shrubs in seedling survival. We found a microsite effect on seedling growth but this effect differed depending on the abiotic environment, with seedlings growing better in open microsites in the less stressful site. The larger abiotic context (climate) played an important role in determining which microsite is the most favorable for seedling growth but not necessarily for the eventual survival of seedlings. Wild ungulates started to damage seedlings early in the growing season, whereas abiotic stress (desiccation) affected mostly those plants that were not previously attacked by animals, showing the hierarchical effect (earlier and longer effect) of the biotic over the abiotic mortality agents. Non-preferred shrubs worked better as nurse shrubs only under high ungulate pressure. From the abiotic perspective, preferred and non-preferred shrubs did not apparently differ in the facilitation effect. Importantly, we found a greater facilitative effect of shrubs on the survival than on the growth of seedlings.

AB In sap flow studies, there is no method complying with high efficiency and versatility of sap flow measurements. To improve that, we propose combining two methods: (1) thermal dissipation probe (TDP) known to be efficient and cost effective and (2) heat field deformation (HFD) known to be versatile. For that purpose, we used a step-wise TDP sap flux density (J(p)) optimization method consisting of (1) natural temperature gradient (NTG) correction applying the cyclic heat dissipation (CHD) method, (2) night flow T-max correction using HFD data as reference and (3) radial-azimuthal correction using HFD as reference. We applied this optimization method on Quercus ilex (Q.i.) and Quercus pyrenaica (Q.p.) trees in a Spanish semi-arid open woodland during dry season. The NTG correction resulted in substantial reduction of J(p) as compared with standard TDP. The subsequent T-max night flow correction resulted in the increase of NTG-corrected J(p) and good agreement with the outermost 2cm of HFD measurements for both species. The final radial-azimuthal adjustment of TDP J(p) resulted not only, in a good agreement with HFD J(p), but also provided novel ecohydrological insights such as: (1) evidence of continuous night flow in all Q.p. trees and some Q.i. trees, (2) exponential reduction of J(p) with sapwood depth for both species, (3) significantly larger J(p) in the outermost 1cm of sapwood for Q.p. than for Q.i. and (4) high azimuthal J(p) variability for both species. The presented study offers efficient and versatile method of tree sap flow measurements that contributed to a better understanding of water-related dynamics of Q.i. and Q.p. under water-stress conditions.

AB AimLarge-scale patterns of limitations in tree recruitment remain poorly described in the Mediterranean Basin, and this information is required to assess the impacts of global warming on forests. Here, we unveil the existence of opposite trends of recruitment limitation between the dominant genera Quercus and Pinus on a large scale and identify the key ecological drivers of these diverging trends.
   LocationSpain
   MethodsWe gathered data from the Spanish National Forest inventory to assess recruitment trends for the dominant species (Pinus halepensis, Pinus pinea, Pinus pinaster, Pinus nigra, Pinus sylvestris, Pinus uncinata, Quercus suber, Quercus ilex, Quercus petraea, Quercus robur, Quercus faginea and Quercus pyrenaica). We assessed the direct and indirect drivers of recruitment by applying Bayesian structural equation modelling techniques.
   ResultsSevere limitations in recruitment were observed across extensive areas for all Pinus species studied, with recruitment failure affecting 54-71% of the surveyed plots. In striking contrast, Quercus species expanded into 41% of the plots surveyed compared to only 10% for Pinus and had a lower local recruitment failure (29% of Quercus localities compared to 63% for Pinus species). Bayesian structural equation models highlighted the key role of the presence of Q.ilex saplings and the increase in the basal area of Q.ilex in limiting recruitment in five Pinus species. The recruitment of P.sylvestris and P.nigra showed the most negative trends and was negatively associated with the impacts of fire.
   Main conclusionsThis study identified Q.ilex, the most widespread species in this area, as a key driver of recruitment shifts on a large scale, negatively affecting most pine species with the advance of forest succession. These results highlight that the future expansion/contraction of Q.ilex stands with ongoing climate change will be a key process indirectly controlling the demographic responses of Pinus species in the Mediterranean Basin.

AB Questions
   (1) Does shrub encroachment affect the regeneration of two contrasting species of oak along an elevation gradient in the west-central Iberian Peninsula? (2) Do different nurse shrubs have any relevant species-specific effects along the gradient? (3) Does shrub encroachment affect the location of the bioclimatic limit between these two oak species along the elevation gradient?
   Location
   Twelve sites distributed from the Arribes del Duero plains to the Sistema Central mountains (Salamanca province, Spain).
   Methods
   We measured the regeneration of two contrasting oak tree species (Quercus ilex subsp. ballota Samp - sclerophyllous, Q.pyrenaica Willd - marcescent) as the relative percentage cover of seedlings and saplings (<1.3-m high) in plots 10m in diameter distributed in stands of different age. We fixed the bioclimatic limit at 50% relative proportion of species in each plot, i.e. whether one species was more abundant than the other in a plot. Shrub stand age was estimated by counting growth rings in the principal stems of the oldest shrubs in a plot. We fitted generalized linear mixed models to analyse the effects of elevation, specific nurse shrub and shrub stand age on regeneration and the probability of one species being more abundant than the other.
   Results
   The regeneration and relative proportion of Q.ilex (sclerophyllous) decreased with elevation. Regeneration did not vary with shrub encroachment, although the relative proportion increased notably in the youngest stands. In turn, regeneration and relative proportion of Q.pyrenaica (deciduous) significantly increased towards the upper sites and mature shrub stands. We found no evidence of specific nurse shrub effects on regeneration or the probability of one species being more abundant than the other in either of the two species of oak.
   Conclusions
   The bioclimatic limit between the two contrasting species of oak shifted with shrub stand age along the elevation gradient. Land practices preventing shrub encroachment can thus indirectly shift this limit towards higher elevations. The effects of shrubs may be critical in resolving the climatic and land-use effects on elevation shifts of species under changing conditions in bioclimatic transitions.

AB Forests modify their productivity, composition, and distribution in response to global change. We studied the radial growth trends of the Western Mediterranean oak Quercus pyrenaica over the last two centuries to analyze whether trees exhibited instability in productivity in response to climatic changes. Trees were sampled to build annual growth chronologies following climatic gradients of increasing moisture availability and decreasing temperature with altitude and latitude. The species' response to climate showed high variability linked to local climatic conditions. The strength in the positive response of trees to moisture availability was inversely related to precipitation (that is, enhanced by higher water stress) whereas high temperature in the growing season was positive for tree-growth only at cold sites. The oldest ages of trees expanded back to the late 1500 s. These old-growth trees were located at the coldest sites and exhibited a long-term increase in productivity starting 150 years ago which could express a dominant positive effect of warming temperatures since the mid 1800 s at cold-humid sites. Conversely, trees at dry sites exhibited negative growth trends. Particularly low elevation stands located at latitudes below 40A degrees displayed enhanced growth constraints with the increase in water stress around 1970, which suggests vulnerability of Quercus pyrenaica at the sampled altitudinal dry edge. The response of trees to future changes in climate should be monitored, particularly in threatened transitional zones.

AB Earlywood vessel features indicate different adaptations of Quercus petraea and Q. pyrenaica , which are probably related with their corresponding Atlantic and sub-Mediterranean ecological requirements.
   We studied the climatic signal of the earlywood anatomy of a temperate [Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl.] and a sub-Mediterranean (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) oak species growing under similar climatic conditions in a transitional area between the Atlantic and Mediterranean regions of the Iberian Peninsula. We hypothesized that both species react differently in their wood anatomy due to their contrasting ecological requirements, and we test the usefulness of earlywood anatomical features to study the behaviour of these ring-porous oaks upon climate. For this, we measured the earlywood vessels, and obtained annual series of several anatomical variables for the period 1937-2006 using dendrochronological techniques, considering whether the vessels belonged to the first row or not. After optimizing the data set by principal component analysis and progressive filtering of large vessels, we selected maximum vessel area and total number of vessels as they resulted to be the optimal variables to describe vessel size and number, respectively. Vessel size of Q. pyrenaica was dependent on precipitation along the previous growing season, whereas it did not show any clear climatic response for Q. petraea. On the contrary, vessel number was related to winter temperature for both species. These relationships observed between climate and anatomy appeared to be stable through time. The results obtained reinforce the utility of earlywood vessel features as potential climate proxies.

AB Wild ungulate populations have increased dramatically in the last decades, limiting tree regeneration. However, how different types of shrubs (chemically vs. physically-defended) act as seedlings facilitators under different types of ungulate damage (browsing or rooting) remains largely unknown. Here, we integrate both biotic and abiotic stress to assess seedling survival in three microsites [open, under chemically-defended (aromatic) shrubs and under physically-defended (spiny) shrubs]. We studied seedling survival of a Mediterranean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) for two contrasting levels of abiotic stress (dry vs. wet growing seasons) in environments where deer (Cervidae) and wild boar (Sus scrofa) are abundant. After the first summer 24.7% of seedlings were still alive in a wet year whereas only 9.0% seedlings survived in a dry year. Seedling survival was higher under shrub cover, independently of the annual weather conditions and the shrub type. Shrubs, on average, reduced seedling mortality by ungulates approximately 75% in a wet year and only 50% in a dry year due to the greater and earlier impact of browsers (deer) in drier years, when preferred food (green grass) is scarce. Physically-defended shrubs prevent wild boar damage better than other microsites, reducing 35-59% boar damage in comparison to other types of shrubs and 70-77% in comparison to open microsites and, therefore, serve as good nurse shrubs in environments where wild boar are abundant. Physically-defended shrubs also worked well as defense against browsers at low abiotic stress (wet years) but diminished its efficiency in comparison to chemically-defended shrubs at high abiotic stress due to the greater browsing activity of deer on spiny shrubs in dry years. Thus, we recommend the use of chemically-defended shrubs as seedling protectors against browsers. Restoration efforts (e.g. reforestation) under high level of ungulates should take into account the type of ungulate damage (browsing vs. rooting) and the predominant type of shrub mechanism against herbivores (chemical vs. physical) to use shrub cover more efficiently in future restoration practices.

AB Biomass combustion leads to the release of huge amounts of toxic contaminants that disturb the atmospheric ambient interfering on climate and creating appalling health effects. However, there is still a lack of information on the physicochemical properties of the emitted products, in special with regard of the particulate phase.
   The main goal of this study was the characterization of size and morphology of particles emitted from combustion of wood from three common Iberian trees (oak -Quercus pyrenaica-, beech -Fagus sylvatica- and poplar -Populus nigra-), in a woodstove. The size of the monomers and the morphological descriptors of the carbon aerosol aggregates were studied by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Digital Image (DIA) techniques.
   The morphological characterization, by parameters such as elongation, concavity and sphericity, allowed to directly link the carbon emission factors (organic carbon vs. elemental carbon, determined by a thermo-optical method), and thus the combustion efficiency rather than with the type of wood, with the recently emitted fresh carbon aggregate structure. A major compactness on the fresh structure will be directly favor the adsorption of readily available atmospheric compounds, directly related to a quicker and higher degree of photochemical oxidation in the atmosphere and severe climate and environmental effects.

AB The current trend of declining epiphytic richness caused by human activities (forest fragmentation, logging, agriculture, and livestock grazing) and the greater efforts required to sample and identify the most inconspicuous species have necessitated the use of indicators of the species richness. In this study, we examined the potential of predicting epiphytic lichen richness based on the richness of a single taxon (family) of the most conspicuous lichens (macrolichens) in Mediterranean woodlands. Since our working hypothesis is that the richness of some conspicuous elements is tightly connected with the total richness, we expect this connection is maintained even after composition shifts (for instance composition changes between coniferous and oak forests). In order to control the large set of confounding factors at macro- and microclimate scales our present study was conducted in 504 forest stands, which represented a wide range of Mediterranean climates, management intensity levels, canopy cover types, and tree sizes. The presence/absence of epiphytic lichens were determined in 7560 trees, which were dominated by coniferous (Pinus nigra and P. sylvestris) and oak (Quercus ilex ssp. ballota, Q, faginea, and Q. pyrenaica) species. In oak forests, the increased richness of Collemataceae and the complex known as "rest of Peltigerales" was followed by an increase in the overall epiphytic richness, whereas there was a strong positive correlation between Parmeliaceae and total epiphytic richness in coniferous forests. In both cases, the richness of these predictors increased in well-preserved forest stands with dense canopies. Thus, we propose the potential use of Parmeliaceae (for coniferous forests) and the Collemataceae and the "rest of Peltigerales" (for oak forests) as indicators in the Mediterranean region because they have a cosmopolitan distribution, grow in a wide range of environmental conditions, and are correlated with changes in the epiphytic richness caused by forest disturbances.

AB A two-stage in vitro procedure was used for assessing the activity of parotid saliva to enhance rumen digestion of tanniniferous browse foliage. The procedure consisted of pre-incubation in saliva for 4 h at 39 degrees C followed by incubation in diluted buffered rumen fluid. Using this procedure, a study was conducted to examine the effects of pre-incubation in sheep (SS), quebracho-supplemented sheep (qSS) and goat (GS) parotid saliva or in McDougall's artificial saliva (AS, used as control) on in vitro rumen fermentation kinetics (estimated using the gas production technique) of browse foliage from six shrub species (Cytisus scoparius, Genista florida, Rosa canina, Quercus pyrenaica, Cistus laurifolius and Erica australis) collected over two seasons (spring and autumn), thus varying the in vitro digestibility (from 0.597 to 0.903) and tannin contents (from 3 to 130 g tannic acid equivalent/kg dry matter (DM)). Saliva was collected from four sheep and four goats fed alfalfa hay, and from four sheep fed the same alfalfa hay but supplemented with quebracho (rich in condensed tannins) for 60 d, through a cannula inserted in the parotid duct, and rumen fluid was always from sheep fed alfalfa hay. The extent of degradation when browse foliage was pre-incubated in qSS was similar to that observed with control AS (0.449 v. 0.452, respectively), and 8% less than the value with pre-incubation in SS (0.490). In vitro fermentation kinetics (gas production parameters) of browse foliage were not significantly enhanced with pre-incubation in qSS compared with SS, whereas in vitro digestibility and extent of degradation in the rumen were significantly reduced with qSS compared with SS. After pre-incubation in sheep and goat saliva, the extent of browse foliage degradation was significantly increased by 4-8% compared with pre-incubation in the control AS. Fermentation efficiency of browse foliage was increased (P<0.05) with pre-incubation in GS compared with SS. Sheep or goat saliva may have some activity to affect in vitro rumen fermentation of the foliage samples incubated, enhancing extent of degradation of tannin-rich browse. However, a relationship between the magnitude of this effect and the tannin content of the browse foliage could not be established, suggesting that sheep and goat saliva may not be particularly important in neutralizing tannins.

AB Knowledge on the distribution and abundance of species is plagued by significant taxonomic and geographic biases that influence the analyses on biodiversity patterns. Due to this, standard, easy-to-use methods are needed to design efficient field campaigns that minimize data deficiencies. We evaluate the applicability, usefulness and effectiveness of a survey design protocol based on the Environmental Diversity (ED) criterion under different scenarios, with examples of varying extent of environmental niche, range of spatial distribution and level of previous knowledge. We planned surveys for epiphytic bryophytes growing in three types of forests at NW Iberian Peninsula (dominated by Quercus ilex, Q. faginea and Q. pyrenaica). Knowledge on the distribution and abundance of epiphytic bryophytes in this region presents large gaps and strong geographic biases. Besides, the three forest types differ in their environmental requirements, spatial distribution and level of previous knowledge, providing three working scenarios to test the response of the protocol under different situations. The protocol was implemented as a set of sequential selection rules, starting by an ED-based criterion aiming at maximizing the coverage of climatic and geographic variability; further criteria include an iterative set of qualitative properties: maximizing forest area, conservation status and accessibility. The protocol performed efficiently at different ranges of spatial distribution levels of environmental variability, and degree of previous knowledge and generated an even distribution of sampling points that efficiently covered the diversity of epiphytic bryophytes. The results show that ED protocols are a proficient and time-saving approach to select sampling sites by objective criteria also for groups with high dispersal ability and fragmented landscapes.

AB Wood formation of Quercus robur and Q. pyrenaica is similar along the growing season, mostly differing in the initial earlywood vessels, which are formed later but faster for Q. pyrenaica.
   We monitored leaf phenology and wood formation during the growing season of 2010 on two oak species (Quercus robur L. and Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) in the northwestern Iberian Peninsula to provide a detailed description of cambial dynamics, with a special focus on earlywood, and to relate phenological phases to simultaneous cambial processes. For this, we used visual survey of buds and leaves, and microscopic observations of microcores taken from stems on the same dates. Sampling intervals were weekly in the early season, and more spaced afterwards. There were no differences in cambial processes among individuals of the same species, whereas some phases of cambial dynamics and phenology were simultaneous for the two species. Cambial reactivation began in middle March, and bud burst was achieved in early May (6 weeks later) for both species, but they differed in the time required for the expansion of vessels in the first row. Vessel enlargement in Q. robur started at the beginning of April, and lasted for 1 month, while it began 2 weeks later in Q. pyrenaica and spanned only 2 weeks. The beginning of secondary wall lignification in the first vessel row was contemporary to bud burst. Earlywood formation lasted until mid-June, when latewood vessels and fibres started to be much more abundant in all individuals. Radial growth ceased in middle September. The total duration of earlywood formation lasted for 3 months in both species, while latewood formation took around two and a half months.

AB Chars were obtained by the pyrolysis of waste wood samples of different origin - silver fir (Abies alba), holm oak (Quercus ilex), stone pine (Pinus pinea) and Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) - at 600 C in a pilot scale installation. The thermo-chemical characteristics of the resulting materials were fully investigated using a combination of standard techniques. The char yield ranged from 23 wt% to 29 wt%, depending on the precursor wood. The recovery of C achieved was 42-51 wt%, increasing with the hemicellulose content of the wood. In addition, the chars had low volatile matter (8-12 wt%) and ash (2.0-8.5 wt%) contents. The higher heating values of the chars were relatively high (31-35 MJ kg(-1)) and comparable to that of a semi-anthracite (silver fir and stone pine chars) or medium-volatile bituminous coal (holm and Pyrenean oak chars). Their combustion intervals, and ignition, volatilization and burnout temperatures, were similar to those of commercial coals. The chars had a microporous structure (pore size <2 nm) with BET surface areas in the range 314-405 m(2) g(-1). Their treatment by CO2 at 800 degrees C resulted in activated carbons with pore sizes below 0.89 nm and BET surface areas of 543-815 m(2) g(-1). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim: The phenolic potential and suitability of seasoned and toasted Portuguese chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill) and oak wood (Quercus pyrenaica) as alternative cooperage materials were evaluated.
   Methods and results : Low-molecular-weight phenols and ellagitannins from seasoned and toasted Portuguese wood species were analysed by HPLC. C. sativa was found to be richer in phenolic compounds than Q. pyrenaica. High concentrations of vescalagin and gallic acid were specific to C. sativa. Toasting significantly reduced the ellagitannin content in both wood types, albeit less markedly in C. sativa. As regards phenolic aldehydes, C. sativa contained substantially greater amounts of vanillic aldehyde, an odour-active compound, than Q. pyrenaica.
   Conclusion: Both types of Portuguese wood are suitable for use as cooperage materials, although chestnut wood is better suited to the heat treatment involved in the coopering process.

AB The replacement of native vegetation by exotic species has the potential to impact detritus based stream ecosystems. To test the possible consequences of vegetation alteration on stream ecosystem functioning we compared the processing rate and invertebrate colonisation of leaves from five different tree species, two natives (Alnus glutinosa and Quercus pyrenaica) and three exotics (Populus x canadensis, Platanus hispanica and Pinus radiata) in three unaltered forested streams in the Atlantic region of northern Spain. Breakdown rates, nitrogen concentration and C:N ratio of incubated leaves, and invertebrate communities in the benthos and bags were analysed. Breakdown rates differed among leaf species and were positively related to initial nitrogen concentration and negatively to the C: N ratio. After the incubation period (6-7 weeks), the differences in nutritional quality among leaf species and the relationship between breakdown rates and litter quality persisted. The density and biomass of macroinvertebrates and shredders associated with litter bags correlated with leaf-nitrogen concentration and explained the differences in breakdown rates. The results indicate that the replacement of native deciduous forest by plant commercial species with leaf-litter of low quality such as plane and pine can affect in-stream organic matter processing and the subsequent transference of energy throughout the food web.

AB Recent land use changes entailed the abandonment of traditional forest practices, which genetic and ecological sustainability should be evaluated in the frame of current socioeconomic and ecological changes. The present study aimed to assess the conservation value of Quercus pyrenaica Willd. in stands subjected to two traditional rural practices, one specific (coppicing) and the other generic (maintenance of open parklands), and their effects on genetic diversity and clonal structure in this singular root sprouting oak at the southern limit of its distribution. Genetic diversity measures of seven nuclear simple sequence repeat markers were compared, and Hardy-Weinberg disequilibria were tested to be originated from recent population demography. Results showed that, regardless of forest structure, the degree of clonality was very similar (similar to 60 %), being allele and lineage density proportional to stem density. Nevertheless, evenness of clonal distribution was higher in coppice, suggesting more homogeneous management than in open woodland. Contrary to previous beliefs, coppice stands do not involve genetic diversity losses; rather, the process of forest conversion into open woodland leads to the removal of numerous genetic lineages and low frequency alleles. The ancient presence of Q. pyrenaica in the region, which constituted quaternary glacial refuge, may contribute to its high genetic diversity. Historical vicissitudes in this anthropogenic deforested territory remark its resilient character; based on a specific fire pre-adaptive trait, continued coppicing fostered the preservation of its natural genetic diversity. This study evidences the importance of the integration of molecular and historical approximations to assess the genetic and conservation status of a secularly profited woody species.

AB Populations at the rear edge of the species' range are often at a high risk of extinction due to their isolation, fragmentation and small population sizes. However, these populations also play a relevant role in the conservation of biodiversity since they may represent a valuable genetic resource. The endangered Cantabrian Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus cantabricus) inhabits deciduous forests of the Cantabrian Mountains of Spain, at the southwestern limit of the species' range. Recently, nine Cantabrian Capercaillie leks were discovered in Pyrenean oak forests of the southern slope of the Cantabrian range, where the subspecies historically occurred. To elucidate if the origin of this peripheral population nucleus is the result of a historical range contraction or a recent re-colonization from the core population, we sampled moulted feathers from all the known leks in the southern peripheral forests and from the adjacent main core population, based on nine microsatellite loci genotypes. No significant genetic differentiation was detected between main core and peripheral forests suggesting that gene flow is not interrupted between these nuclei. Contrary to expected, peripheral forests did not represent sink populations, since gene flow mainly occurred from southern peripheral to northern main core forests. Therefore, the origin of these birds inhabiting the peripheral nucleus seems not to be a recent colonization but relicts from the former distribution range that have remained unnoticed in a drier and warmer environment than described so far for the species. Cantabrian Capercaillie faces a high risk of extinction in the southernmost forests of its distribution, not only because of its peripheral location but also due to its small population size, low genetic diversity and low incoming gene flow. According to our results, this peripheral nucleus could represent an expanding edge for the population if Pyrenean oak forests continue to spread out southwards and consequently stress the need for conservation programs to preserve habitat availability and forest connectivity.

AB Pine and oak are common tree species in the Vila Real district, northern Portugal, a region where forests are an important land use (38%). The net primary production (NPP) of these forests is not well known. The objective of this study was to quantify the aboveground biomass and aboveground NPP (ANPP) of pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton), pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) and mixed pine-oak forests in the Vila Real district and to evaluate the relationships between ANPP and their stand characteristics. To achieve this objective, 15 stands of pine, 15 stands of oak and 9 stands of mixed pine-oak were studied between 2008 and 2011. ANPP average (and range) of pine, oak and mixed stands were 7.9 (2.9-15.1), 7.3 (3.0-12.1), and 12.1 (6.5-17.2) Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), to reduce the within-groups variability and detect the differences between the stand compositions, was performed. In this analysis, we rejected the null hypothesis that the composition stands had the same mean among ANPP. Mixed stands had a significantly higher mean ANPP than pine or oak. Also, we verified that in pine, the greater distribution of biomass was on the stem (4.0 +/- 0.7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), 50% of the total productivity) component where carbon sequestration is retained longer, whereas in oak and mixed stands the foliage was the component with the greater distribution of biomass (4.0 and 6.0 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). Aboveground biomass was significantly different among the three stands types and averaged 83.4, 61.4 and 110.5 Mg ha(-1) for pine, oak and mixed stands, respectively. Regression models performed showed that there was a strong relationship between aboveground biomass and basal area in all stands. This study concludes that the production efficiency, defined as stem productivity/leaf area index, was significantly different in mixed stands. Pine had the greatest production efficiency in all stand types and, in mixed stands, had 85% of the total production efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Growth projections using ecological models fitted to data collected along climatic gradients can help to understand how forests will respond to climate change. Stem growth of two Mediterranean oaks was predicted using nonlinear multiplicative models as a function of precipitation and minimum temperature of the hydrological year fitted to dendrochronological data. The growth of both species increased nonlinearly with accumulated precipitation before reaching an asymptote, but the species with a warmer niche (Q. ilex, an evergreen species) required lower levels of precipitation to achieve high relative growth. The species-specific relationship between growth and minimum temperature exhibited an optimum for the two species. Trees were negatively affected by high minimum temperatures whereas they responded negatively (Q ilex) or neutrally (Q, pyrenaica, a deciduous species) to low temperatures along the climatic gradient analyzed. Growth would decrease rapidly when minimum temperatures rose above approximately 7 degrees C for Q. pyrenaica and 9 degrees C for Q ilex. Most growth projections suggest a likely future decrease in productivity along the species range for Q. pyrenaica and particularly at species-specific warm, dry locations pointed to a future drastic reduction in productivity as a result of the increase in temperatures without a paired increase in precipitation forecasted by the different climate scenarios considered. In agreement with results from studies modeling future distribution of species this suggests that Q. pyrenaica could be threatened by climate change at the species local dry edge where, in addition, stands often present a lack of seed regeneration. More drought tolerant Q ilex might profit from warming temperatures at cold northern locations but would also reduce productivity at warm, dry locations. Stem growth was successfully modeled using biologically meaningful species-specific responses to climate which provided key ecological information to understand the functional response of the two species. The models used have much potential to be applied with dendroecological data to study the response of forests to climate change. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A study on the phenolic composition of Portuguese and Spanish Castanea sativa and Quercus pyrenaica woods used in cooperage has been carried out with the aim of looking for an extra value for the wood residues generated in cooperage industries. Results showed that both species are an important source of valuable phenolic compounds, although differences in the phenolic content were found. Chestnut samples showed the highest concentration of total phenolic compounds, being especially rich in vescalagin, gallic acid, vanillic aldehyde and syringaldehyde. The geographical origin was another parameter to take into account. Portuguese chestnut samples showed higher amounts of phenolic compounds than the Spanish samples, with vescalagin, gallic acid, vanillic acid and syringaldehyde being the most important features. As a consequence, the residues generated in the cooperage industry from chestnut and Q. pyrenaica heartwood seem to be an important source of valuable phenolic compounds, particularly those from Portuguese chestnuts.

AB Biomass growing stocks, harvesting productivity and costs of energy production, were studied in thinnings of Quercus pyrenaica. Eleven forest sites were selected in coppices located in Castilla y Leon (Spain). Three systems were employed for harvesting: a mechanised whole tree harvesting (WTH) system, which included chipping at landing; a fully mechanised cut-to-length (CTL) harvesting system for firewood; and a semi-mechanised CTL system with manual felling and bunching. Three WTH trials had a hauling off 34.7 -44.1 oven-dried tonnes (odt) ha(-1). In contrast, only 11.6-30.0 odt ha were obtained in the other eight CTL trials. Biomass weight equations for stems and whole trees were fitted. Worker operations were time-studied using software designed by the authors. The WTH system reached maximum productivity rates of 3.9 oven-dried tonnes per productive hour (odt h(-1)) for the felling and bunching operation and 6.9 odt h(-1) for the forwarding operation. The mechanised CTL harvesting method achieved a productivity range of 1.3 -0.5 odt h(-1) for the harvesting operation. Furthermore, the average forwarding productivity was 7.3 odt h(-1). Motor-manual felling and crosscutting in the CTL system accomplished a productivity range of 0.7-1.9 odt h(-1). Manual bunching resulted in similar values. The lowest firewood unit cost for trees with 10 cm of diameter at breast height (DBH) was 62.0 (sic) odt(-1) using a semi-mechanised CTL system. Under similar conditions, this cost was 85.2 (sic) odt(-1) for the mechanised CTL system. Finally, the cost corresponding to chips at landing from WTH sites (average DBH = 10 cm) was 65.3 (sic) odt(-1). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mediterranean forests are vulnerable to numerous threats including wildfires due to a combination of climatic factors and increased urbanization. In addition, increased temperatures and summer drought lead to increased risk of forest fires as a result of climate change. This may have important consequences for C dynamics and balance in these ecosystems. Soil respiration was measured over 2 successive years in Holm oak (Quercus ilex subsp. ballota; Qi); Pyrenean Oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd; Qp); and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.; Ps) forest stands located in the area surrounding Madrid (Spain), to assess the long term effects of wildfires on C efflux from the soil, soil properties, and the role of soil temperature and soil moisture in the variation of soil respiration.
   Soil respiration, soil temperature, soil moisture, fine root mass, microbial biomass, biological and chemical soil parameters were compared between non burned (NB) and burned sites (B).
   The annual C losses through soil respiration from NB sites in Qi, Qp and Ps were 790, 1010, 1380 gCm(-2) yr(-1), respectively, with the B sites emitting 43 %, 22 % and 11 % less in Qi, Qp and Ps respectively. Soil microclimate changed with higher soil temperature and lower soil moisture in B sites after fire. Exchangeable cations and the pH also decreased. The total SOC stocks were not significantly altered, but 6-8 years after wildfires, there was still measurably lower fine root and microbial biomass, while SOC quality changed, indicated by lower the C/N ratio and the labile carbon and a relative increase in refractory SOC forms, which resulted in lower Q(10) values.
   We found long term effects of wildfires on the physical, chemical and biological soil characteristics, which in turn affected soil respiration. The response of soil respiration to temperature was controlled by moisture and changed with ecosystem type, season, and between B and NB sites. Lower post-burn Q(10) integrated the loss of roots and microbial biomass, change in SOC quality and a decrease in soil moisture.

AB Tree transpiration is an important plant-physiological process that influences the water cycle, thereby influencing ecosystems and even the quantity of available water resources. However, direct tree-transpiration measurements, particularly at large spatial scales, are still rare, due to the complexities associated with natural ecosystems. In this study we describe a scaling-up method for quantifying dry-season tree transpiration (T-c) of the Sardon catchment, located in Central-Western Spain, 50 km west of Salamanca. The method is applied to an oak woodland in that catchment which is dominated by two tree species: evergreen Quercus ilex and deciduous Quercus pyrenaica (Q.i. and Q.p., respectively). The method comprises five complementary steps: (a) sap-flux density (J(p)) measurement; (b) definition of biometric-upscaling functions; (c) spatial scaling-up of tree transpiration using high-resolution remote-sensing-derived object attributes (50-60 cm per pixel); (d) modelling of dry-season temporal sap-flow variability; and (e) an assessment of the robustness/uncertainty of the method. The proposed method was applied to assess dry-season tree transpiration, however if there is appropriate sap flow data available, it can also be applied during any season of the year. The application of the proposed method to map tree transpiration in the Sardon catchment resulted in a mean J(p) = 58.4 cm(3) cm(-2) day(-1) for Q.p., characterized by tree density of 19 trees ha(-1), and a mean J(p) = 37.1 cm(3) cm(-2) day(-1) for Q.i., characterized by tree density of 4 trees ha(-1). The J(p) data varied as dependent on the weather conditions and not on the change of soil moisture. The mean normalised tree transpiration (T-t) estimated per species, was also higher for Q.p. (1.19 mm day(-1) +/- 8%) than for Q.i. (0.83 mm day(-1) +/- 25%) trees. The remote-sensing scaling up of tree transpiration for the Sardon catchment resulted in a low mean dry-season T-c, = 0.045 mm day(-1) (+/- 1%) typical for water limited environments with sparse tree coverage (average approximate to 7%). In that T-c, Q.p represented 79%, whereas Q.i. 21%. The dry-season T-c varied spatially at 1 ha resolution but barely temporally throughout the dry season. The obtained T-c maps can be readily used as input for distributed models in water resources and land management decision-making. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mediterranean forests are especially prone to fire, a periodic disturbance that affects all the ecosystem components in different ways. Gathering knowledge on the particular responses and rate of recovery of multiple ecosystem components following a wildfire is crucial to reliably evaluate its consequences on biodiversity. Using eight sampling transects, we studied the changes in four ecosystem components (topsoil, plants, carabids, and staphylinids) during three years after a spring wildfire in a Quercus pyrenaica forest; and compared them with the surrounding unburnt forest (hereafter control). We found great variety of responses to fire suggesting each component may deal with this recurring disturbance via different adaptations, and that the time spent to recover to pre-disturbance conditions depends on the group of focus. Topsoil characteristics were highly variable and minor differences were found between burnt and control transects. Plant community was considerably affected by fire but rapidly recovered exceeding the control forest in species richness and cover, partly due to proliferation of annual herbs. However, plant species composition differed between burnt and control forests during the whole study period. Carabid beetles were more abundant and richer in species in the burnt forest, thanks to the arrival of seed predators favoured by post-fire drier and warmer conditions. Staphylinid beetle composition differed between control and burnt transects during the whole period, although their abundance was strongly variable. Distinct post-fire plant, carabid and staphylinid species composition suggests scattered low-intensity wildfires in this region may help to maintain habitat heterogeneity benefiting biodiversity at the landscape scale.

AB Sympatric hybridizing oak species provide a model system for studying local adaptation. Disjunct populations of Quercus rubra L. and Quercus ellipsoidalis E. J. Hill at the northern edge of their distribution may harbor important reservoirs of adaptive genetic variation. Genic (expressed sequence tag- simple sequence repeat = EST-SSR) and non-genic nuclear microsatellite (nuclear SSR = nSSR) markers were used to estimate neutral and potentially adaptive genetic variation in these two supposedly interfertile oak species showing different adaptations to drought. Eleven populations of putative Q. rubra and Q. ellipsoidalis located in the Western Upper Peninsula of Michigan were characterized using seven EST-SSRs and eight nSSRs. Bayesian cluster analysis revealed two distinct groups corresponding to each species with evidence of low levels of potential introgression. A comparison of the genetic structure of adult trees and seedlings revealed no evidence for selection against hybrids. Overall, similar levels of genetic variation and differentiation between populations and species were found at both EST-SSRs and nSSRs indicating that most EST-SSRs chosen reflect neutral variation. Two loci, 3A05 (nSSR) and GOT021 (EST-SSR, putative histidine kinase 4-like), were identified as putative outlier loci between species showing largely reduced variation in Q. ellipsoidalis. Future analyses of an increased number of EST-SSRs located in functional genes will allow the identification of genes involved in the reproductive isolation between both species.

AB A series of experiments were conducted to characterize formaldehyde and acetaldehyde emissions from residential combustion of common wood species growing in Portugal. Five types of wood were investigated: maritime pine (Pinus pinaster), eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus), cork oak (Quercus suber), holm oak (Quercus rotundifolia) and pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica). Laboratory experiments were performed with a typical wood stove used for domestic heating in Portugal and operating under realistic home conditions. Aldehydes were sampled from diluted combustion flue gas using silica cartridges coated with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection. The average formaldehyde to acetaldehyde concentration ratio (molar basis) in the stove flue gas was in the range of 2.1-2.9. Among the tested wood types, pyrenean oak produced the highest emissions for both formaldehyde and acetaldehyde: 1772 +/- 649 and 1110 +/- 454 mg kg(-1) biomass burned (dry basis), respectively. By contrast, maritime pine produced the lowest emissions: 653 +/- 151 and 371 +/- 162 mg kg(-1) biomass (dry basis) burned, respectively. Aldehydes were sampled separately during distinct periods of the holm oak wood combustion cycles. Significant variations in the flue gas concentrations were found, with higher values measured during the devolatilization stage than in the flaming and smoldering stages. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The identification and quantification of the relative importance of reproductive isolating barriers is of fundamental importance to understand species maintenance in the face of interspecific gene flow between hybridising species. Yet, such assessments require extensive experimental fertilisations that are particularly difficult when dealing with more than two hybridising and long-generation-time species such as oaks. Here, we quantify the relative contribution of four postmating reproductive isolating barriers consisting of two prezygotic barriers (gametic incompatibility, conspecific pollen precedence) and two postzygotic barriers (germination rate, early survival) from extensively controlled pollinations between four oak species (Quercus robur, Quercus petraea, Quercus pubescens and Quercus pyrenaica) that have been shown to frequently hybridise in natural populations. We found high variation in the strength of total reproductive isolation between species, ranging from total reproductive isolation to advantage toward hybrid formation. As previously found, Q. robur pollen was unable to fertilise Q. petraea due to a strong reproductive isolating mechanism. On the contrary, Q. pubescens pollen was more efficient at fertilising Q. petraea than conspecific pollen. Overall, prezygotic barriers contribute far more than postzygotic barriers to isolate species reproductively, suggesting a role for reinforcement in the development of prezygotic barriers. Conspecific pollen precedence reduced hybrid formation when pollen competition was allowed; however, presence of conspecific pollen did not totally prevent hybridization. Our results suggest that pollen competition depends on multiple ecological and environmental parameters, including species local abundance, and that it may be of uppermost importance to understand interspecific gene flow among natural multispecies populations.

AB Quercus pyrenaica Willd. had been historically subjected to intense coppice management in order to supply firewood, charcoal and cattle forage. Due to the emergence of new energy sources and rural exodus, more than 1,200,000 hectares of coppice stands in Spain have been abandoned since 1970. Stand degradation, stem top drying, low production, scarce acorn yield and absence of sexual regeneration are major problems of these coppices. The need to establish new uses by conversion to high forest has been widely recognized and several attempts by thinning have been tested. We suggest that through a shift in the scale of species knowledge, from stand to clonal individual level, we can achieve a better understanding of Q. pyrenaica dynamics for the purpose of applying more effective silvicultural methods. Our objective in this study was to evaluate the effect of individual stool (clonal clump) characteristics influencing stem growth. We performed genetic analyses to assess clonal membership in a one-hectare plot, and 145 stems belonging to 15 different stools were sampled to model individual stem section growth, considering both stem and clonal stool variables. Principal component and cluster analyses were performed to analyze variability among stools. Results revealed that initial stem diameter explained most of the variability in stem growth (R-adj(2) = 0.61). However, the inclusion of clonal stool variables and clonal membership as a qualitative variable improved every modeling performance criterion, reducing mean square error 11% and 25%, respectively. Stems belonging to large biomass stools (determined by large spatial extent, high number of stems within stool, and a high value of a stump root biomass indicator) had lower growth potential than those belonging to small biomass stools. Based on these results, we suggest that root aging (enlarged root biomass) leads to a root/shoot imbalance increase, which consumes, through root respiration, a great proportion of the resources supplied by photosynthesis, thus limiting stem growth. This work attempts to highlight the importance of multidisciplinary perspectives to successfully face management challenges in these forests. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aboveground tree biomass and nutrient pools, litterfall, and weight loss of litter due to decomposition have been measured in two permanent plots of evergreen oak forest (Quercus ilex L.) of the Middle Moroccan Atlas area (Tafachna and Reggada). The aboveground biomass was estimated by cutting and weighing twenty trees from each site according to diameter classes. In order to establish biomass regression equations the best fit was obtained by applying the allometric method: Y (biomass)=aX (X=((DH)-H-2)(b), D and H are respectively the diameter at 1.30m and tree height. The aboveground biomass of the two studied stands was: 96.0 and 86.4t ha(-1), respectively, for Tafachna and Reggada of which the woody part accounts for approximately 96%. The average productions of litter are, respectively, 3030 and 3560kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for Tafachna and Reggada. The leaves account for approximately 70% of the total litterfall, restored to the soil 38.3kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for Tafachana and 44.6kg ha(-1) an(-1) for Reggada (approximately 74% of the total nutrient amount of the litterfall). The decomposition pattern of the leaves litter follows a negative exponential equation of form RF=A +B exp (-kt). The nitrogen was the bioelement that contributed the greatest amount to the biogeochemical cycling between vegetation and soil. At the level of internal exchange to the trees, translocation, and transfer, the nitrogen was followed by phosphorus and potassium.

AB Stand Density Management Diagrams are useful tools for designing and evaluating alternative density management regimes without the need of implementing any silvicultural action, and allowing the future stand conditions to be predicted prior to implementing management schedules. In this study, stand density management diagrams were developed for Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) stands in north-west Spain by including data on stand volume, stand aboveground biomass, stand stem biomass and carbon pools. Data were obtained from Third National Forest Inventory plots (n=1860). The large geographical area analyzed in this study was classified by provenance regions, which were compared in terms of biomass production in order to define areas with similar characteristics for use as management units. The comparisons identified 6 independent groups. Different stand-level models and the associated diagrams for the aforementioned stand variables were therefore developed for each group.

   pyrenaica eastern forest
AB The degraded state, scattered distribution and substrate type of Quercus pyrenaica forests in eastern Spain make them a subject of particular interest, as well as a priority for conservation efforts. An extension of Dufrene and Legendre's indicator value (IndVal) analysis was applied to one hundred releves. This extension of the IndVal method allowed us, by considering the preference of species for combinations of releve groups, to obtain those species that represent local, but also regional, characteristics (as a new practical use). Our objective was to identify the species that best indicate the main ecological features of these broad-leaved oak forests. The usefulness of our analysis was evidenced at two levels: local indicator species, showing the characteristic species of individual sites and including the presence of endemics in the area; and indicator species of combinations of two or more sites, reflecting the affinities or relationships between these scattered forests.
   Most singular forests showed a higher number of local indicator species. The indicator species of each site combination represent the main ecological traits shared by these groups - such as proximity to the coast, land uses or postglacial migration pathways - thereby defining their relationships. Indicator value analysis with site group combinations (Multipatt function) proved to be a useful tool for the identification of different species that could serve both to determine the local forest conservation status and aid in its preservation, as well as contributing to an understanding of the life history of larger territories.

AB Spatial discordance between primary and effective dispersal in plant populations indicates that postdispersal processes erase the seed rain signal in recruitment patterns. Five different models were used to test the spatial concordance of the primary and effective dispersal patterns in a European beech (Fagus sylvatica) population from central Spain. An ecological method was based on classical inverse modelling (SSS), using the number of seed/seedlings as input data. Genetic models were based on direct kernel fitting of mother-to-offspring distances estimated by a parentage analysis or were spatially explicit models based on the genotype frequencies of offspring (competing sources model and Moran-Clark's Model). A fully integrated mixed model was based on inverse modelling, but used the number of genotypes as input data (gene shadow model). The potential sources of error and limitations of each seed dispersal estimation method are discussed. The mean dispersal distances for seeds and saplings estimated with these five methods were higher than those obtained by previous estimations for European beech forests. All the methods show strong discordance between primary and effective dispersal kernel parameters, and for dispersal directionality. While seed rain was released mostly under the canopy, saplings were established far from mother trees. This discordant pattern may be the result of the action of secondary dispersal by animals or density-dependent effects; that is, the Janzen-Connell effect.

AB Three experiments were conducted to study the effect of the administration of young leaves of Quercus pyrenaica (OL) on in vivo ruminal fermentation in relation to oak tannin toxicosis in cattle. In Experiment 1, six bulls were fed up to 5 kg fresh matter (FM) of OL per animal and day for 14 days. In Experiment 2, another six bulls were first subjected to severe feed restriction for 8 days and then fed a higher amount of OL (approximately 10 kg FM daily) for 3 days. In Experiment 3, three bulls received the same amount of OL as in Experiment 1 for 6 days, but adding a severe feed restriction as in Experiment 2. In situ DM disappearance of grass hay and OL, and pH and ammonia and volatile fatty acid concentrations were recorded throughout the three assays. Daily administration of up to 5 kg OL did not considerably affect ruminal fermentation, unless it was preceded by a severe feed restriction period. Administration of 10 kg OL preceded by undernutrition triggered a critical reduction in rumen fermentation activity concomitantly with an acute intoxication. Interestingly, some results differ from those observed previously in vitro, which highlights the importance of validating in vitro data with in vivo measurements, given the complexity of extrapolation in ruminants.

AB Potential biomass production and carbon sequestration were studied in relation to different site index conditions, stand densities and silvicultural treatments for the main forest species in northwest Spain. Site quality, stand density and silvicultural treatments affected biomass production and carbon sequestration and, therefore, optimal rotation length. Potential biomass production and carbon sequestration were highest and optimal rotations were shortest for the best site indexes, highest initial stand densities and the silvicultural treatments that involved least disturbance. Fast-growing species can be used as both energy crops (biomass) and carbon sinks, which contribute to mitigating climate change. However, as slow-growing species act as sinks for longer, they are preferable for planting in environments that are less suitable for fast-growing species.

AB Background and aims - This is the first report on early vegetation dynamics in prescribed slash-pile burns under a sub-Mediterranean climate. We studied a managed forest system of Pinus sylvestris plantations in the upper belt of Quercus pyrenaica forests in the Guadarrama Mountains (Spanish Central System). We investigated post-fire plant succession in order to assess how fire affects tree regeneration and species composition (vascular plants, bryophytes and fungi) in the first three years.
   Methods - Species composition, species cover, number of pine seedlings and ecological data were recorded in twenty slash-pile burnt plots and twenty control plots the first and second year after fire. To identify ecological indicators and examine post-fire succession, we determined Indicator Analysis and Neighbour Joining Tree, respectively. Wilcoxon's signed-ranks test and Spearman's coefficient of rank correlation were used to study the effects of fire on pine seedlings survival and its changes overtime. Principal Components Analysis was performed to assess the relationships between environmental and structural variables in burnt plots.
   Key results - The early plant community established after slash-pile prescribed burns was characterized by three pioneer species: Funaria hygrometrica (moss), Coltricia perennis and Psathyrella pennata (fungi). No taxonomical changes were detected in vascular plant families but there was an increased presence of therophytes and pine seedlings. Two early vegetation stages were identified relating to species richness and Funaria hygrometrica cover. Fire significantly increased pine seedlings density, which subsequently decreased overtime. Survival of one-year old pine seedlings was unrelated to the year of the burn.
   Conclusions - We highlight the importance of bryophyte and fungi species in comparison to seeder species as indicators of recent prescribed slash-pile burns under a sub-Mediterranean climate; and also point out the impact of prescribed slash-pile burns on pine seedling recruitment after the first years post-fire. This recruitment decelerates over time in burnt sites, and it is more pronounced in control plots.

AB In this study, we combined the analysis of a coenocline with HuismanOlffFresco (HOF) modelling of species behaviour to describe colonization patterns of woody species on reclaimed coal wastes in northern Spain. We hypothesize that fine-scale variation in abiotic factors along the forest-grassland gradient that appears after mining restoration affects colonization pattern of woody species. To understand these factors, we analysed changes in floristic composition and abundance of the main woody colonizers according to the spatial distance from forest limit, as well as the spatial variability of some edaphic and microclimatic parameters. Our results showed how the primary coenocline extracted from DCA1 reflected a gradient in environmental conditions influencing the species composition of the woody plant communities, from the more shade, moist and dense forest on acid and rich soils to the open, dry and oligotrophic grassland. The colonization pattern of woody species is affected by fine-scale variations in abiotic factors, such as the increase in pH, P, light, and the decrease in K, N, C/N, organic matter and soil moisture, from the forest to the restored mine. Most species HOF modelled showed monotone responses with decreasing trends along the environmental gradient from forest to mine, being Quercus petraea the species clearly dominant in the forest. On the contrary, Cytisus scoparius and Genista florida colonize intensely in the mine area, reaching the maximum abundance around 15 and 10?m distance from the forest limit, respectively. We conclude that the composition of woody species in the forest is not a good predictor of the colonizing intensity, not even of the species composition in the mine area.

AB The replacement of native forest with plantations of other species may have important impacts on ecosystems. Some of these impacts have been widely studied, but very little is known about the effects on fungal communities and specifically endophytic fungi. In this study, endophyte assemblages in pine plantations (Pinus sylvestris, P nigra and P. pinaster) and native oak forests (Quercus pyrenaica) in the north of the province of Palencia (Spain) were analyzed. For this purpose, samples of needles/leaves and twigs were collected from three trees in each of three plots sampled per host species. The samples were later processed in the laboratory to identify all of the endophytic species present. In addition, an exhaustive survey was carried out of the twelve sites to collect data on the environmental, crown condition, dendrometric and soil variables that may affect the distribution of the fungi. The endophyte assemblages isolated from P sylvestris and P nigra were closely related to each other, but were different from those isolated from P. pinaster. The endophytes isolated from Q. pyrenaica were less closely related to those from the other hosts, and therefore preservation of oak stands is important to prevent the loss of fungal diversity. Finally, the distribution of the endophyte communities was related to some of the environmental variables considered.

AB In 2005, the European Union authorized the use of oak wood pieces in winemaking, and consequently, the addition of oak chips has been generalized. Thus, the antioxidant capacity, scavenger activity, and ellagitannins content from fourteen different commercial oak wood pieces (Quercus spp.) that can be found on the Portuguese market as alternatives to barrels for aging wines were studied. Commercial oak wood pieces samples from Quercus petraea had significantly higher antioxidant activity values than the pieces from Quercus alba species. In general, antioxidant capacity and scavenging activity decrease with the toasting level of the oak wood pieces samples analyzed. A similar effect was detected in the individual ellagitannin content studied. On the other hand, with the toasting process, the total phenolic content and the ellagic acid concentration increased. Finally, a correlation analysis revealed that ellagitannins contribute to the antioxidant capacity of oak wood pieces studied. From the data presented in this paper, antioxidant capacity and ellagitannin content of the oak wood pieces studied have been clearly related either to the oak wood species used, particle size, or to toasting levels.

AB Interactions of N and P cycles and those of other macro-elements in forests are scarcely known.
   This study compares the P cycle in two very different forest ecosystems where soil P availability is low (tropical dry forest in Mexico and Mediterranean forest in Spain) in relation to Ca, K, and Mg cycles.
   Compiled data belonging to these two forest sites are discussed, comparing the P and base cation budgets and exploring relationships among P and base cation cycles.
   Broad differences between input and output of base cations were observed. Analysis of the P budget indicates P retention inside both forest ecosystems. The tropical dry forest has higher nutrient contents than those found in the Mediterranean temperate forest. Chemical composition of forest leaves and litters, and base cation-P ratios varied according to soil P availability and cation concentrations. However, P resorption is higher in the tropical dry forest than in the temperate one.
   This study reveals the existence of P retention at the ecosystem level in both forests, but suggested P limitation at the Mediterranean forest seems to be stronger than that occurring at the tropical forest.

AB The effect of non-reproductive trees and saplings as a physical barrier to pollen dispersal in wind-pollinated species' forests has not received enough attention in the literature so far. The neighborhood seedling model was used to fit pollen dispersal models for beech at different stages of gap recolonization and to elucidate the effect of saplings as a physical barrier on pollen dispersal at local scale. Phenological overlap of leaf emergence, and pollen release as well as wind directionality patterns were also examined. As a case study, we used a mixed beech-oak forest that was managed as open woodland until 1974. The ban on entry of cattle has led to the recolonization of empty spaces by seedlings and saplings of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and two oak species (Quercus petraea (Matts.) Liebl. and Q. pyrenaica Willd.) and, at last, to canopy closure. The average pollen dispersal distance for the first plants that regenerated in the gaps was almost twice those found for recently installed seedlings and seeds collected in traps, supporting the hypothesis that the understory may act as a physical barrier to pollen dispersal. Although a substantial part of effective pollination directionality is at random, horizontal winds and vertical anabatic winds may explain some of this directionality. At the time of beech pollen release, leaves of beech and sessile oak are fully developed, enhancing pollen interception by the saplings. Explicit models of pollen dispersal for wind-pollinated trees should incorporate the effect of canopy closure caused by growth of saplings and account for leaf phenology of co-occurring species in the forest.

AB Information about variations in basic density (BD) and carbon content (%C) along tree stems is key to assessing forest carbon sinks.
   The aim of the study was to determine any differences in %C and BD between different woody tissues (bark, sapwood and heartwood) in two widespread European oak species (Quercus pyrenaica and Quercus petraea).
   Twenty trees were felled in northern Spain, and 317 discs cut from the trees were dried and analysed to determine %C and BD.
   There were significant differences in %C between bark, heartwood and sapwood, and between species. There were also significant differences in BD between the tissues (heartwood > sapwood > bark), and the BD was higher in Q. petraea than in Q. pyrenaica. Both %C and BD varied along the stem.
   More accurate estimates of carbon contents were obtained by using specific values for different heights and anatomical parts, than by using single values.

AB Cavity shortage limits secondary cavity-nesting birds (SCN) assemblages in intensively-managed forests with few cavities, but whether cavity availability limits SCN in cavity-rich forests remains unclear. To address this issue, we used a replicated before-after-control-impact design in which the availability of cavities was experimentally reduced and increased in cavity-rich Quercus pyrenaica forests. Cavity-blocking and nest-box addition led to reduction by 66% and increase by 185%, respectively, of nest densities of blue (Cyanistes caeruleus) and great (Parus major) tits. Analysis of cavity characteristics suggests that tits occupied less suitable cavities in blocking plots compared to control and nest-box addition plots after treatments, further indicating that the availability of suitable nest-sites may limit tit populations. No effect of cavity manipulation was found for short-toed treecreepers (Certhia brachydactyla) and Eurasian nuthatches (Sitta europaea), which defend larger territories than tits and whose numbers may be more influenced by territoriality than by nest-sites. Alternatively, high plasticity in nest-site use of treecreepers may enable them to cope with reductions in cavity availability and increased interspecific competition. Spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor) were little affected by cavity manipulation. Often foraging on pastures, starlings may be more limited through reduced foraging opportunities in this forested landscape than by nest-sites. In addition, starlings may exclude other species from their preferred cavities to cope with reductions in numbers of suitable cavities. Community responses to the variation in cavity abundance in cavity-rich Pyrenean oak forests may therefore vary considerably among species, depending on their plasticity in nest-site use, behavioral dominance, foraging conditions or social structure. Thus, management actions aimed to increase cavity abundance and suitability for SCN communities in cavity-rich forests should consider inter-specific interactions and species-specific characteristics of the targeted species.

AB Seed recalcitrant behavior influences germination capacity determining establishment and colonization potential of seed desiccation sensitive species. The purpose of this study is to compare acorn recalcitrant behavior of different Iberian Quercus species. Seed lots of Q. suber, Q. canariensis, Q. faginea, Q. pyrenaica and two Q. ilex provenances were subjected to dehydration and germination tests; statistical relationships between parameters quantifying desiccation sensitivity, dehydration rates and site environmental records were analyzed. Results revealed a different specific recalcitrant behavior when acorns were dried at same conditions. Dehydration rate was significantly correlated with desiccation sensitivity since faster desiccation processes result in higher viability maintenance, and also a significant positive correlation between precipitation records during seed development period and desiccation tolerance has been shown. Reasons for these patterns are discussed as well as its biological implications in regard to environmental adaptation and dispersal processes.

AB Regeneration of Mediterranean forests is severely limited. Multiple abiotic factors are known to constrain the establishment of woody seedlings at its first phases, such as summer drought or excessive incident radiation, but less attention has been paid to the role of intra-specific variation in seedling performance. In this study we investigate the relative influence of environment (light availability, soil moisture and summer irrigation) and intrinsic factors (seed mass and maternal origin) as determinants of within-population variability in the early establishment of four coexisting Mediterranean oaks (Quercus ilex, Quercus suber, Quercus faginea and Quercus pyrenaica), from emergence and early growth to second-year survival in a field experiment. Seed size was a poor predictor of seed and seedling success. Instead, mother identity showed a stronger effect on seedling performance. Time and percentage of emergence, establishment success and morphological traits varied among seedlings from different maternal trees but main drivers for each variable were different for each species. In addition to a direct effect, in many cases mother-related intrinsic traits and seed mass influenced the effects of environmental conditions on seedling performance. The role of intrinsic factors was masked under ameliorated conditions (i.e. summer irrigation), indicating the relevant role of within-population variability to cope with highly heterogeneous and unpredictable Mediterranean environments.

AB Quercus forest regeneration is limited by different factors, post-dispersal predation being one of the most critical stages. We analysed seed removal of four coexisting Quercus species (Q. ilex, Q. suber, Q. faginea and Q. pyrenaica) in a Mediterranean forest located in Southern Spain. Marked and weighed acorns from each of the species were placed in experimental units with or without exclusion of large herbivores and in two microhabitat types (Q. ilex shade or open). Acorn removal was monitored for 120 days in order to test the effect of exclusion of large herbivore and microhabitat type on seed removal rates and species selection. Interestingly, the results of microhabitat and species selection differed depending on the presence of large herbivores. Removal was faster in sites without exclusion, where most seeds (approximate to 85%) disappeared during the first 9 days. In these sites, no differences in seed removal were found between different microhabitats, but seeds of two species, those with higher seed mass (Q. suber and Q. pyrenaica) were most preferred. However, under exclusion of large herbivores, seed removal was affected by the microhabitat, this being greater in Q. ilex shaded microhabitats, which showed a higher structural diversity. Also, species selection was completely different under exclusion of large herbivores, and seeds of Q. ilex and Q. faginea were removed faster. These results highlight the importance of large herbivore activity on seed removal and its effect on microhabitat and species selection. Therefore, specific selection by seed consumers may modify seedling recruitment and may have an important influence on the relative abundance of coexisting Quercus species.

AB To estimate forest carbon pools from forest inventories it is necessary to have biomass models or biomass expansion factors. In this study, tree biomass models were developed for the main hardwood forest species in Spain: Alnus glutinosa, Castanea sativa, Ceratonia siliqua, Eucalyptus globulus, Fagus sylvatica, Fraxinus angustifolia, Olea europaea var. sylvestris, Populus x euramericana, Quercus canariensis, Quercus faginea, Quercus ilex, Quercus pyrenaica and Quercus suber. Different tree biomass components were considered: stem with bark, branches of different sizes, above and belowground biomass. For each species, a system of equations was fitted using seemingly unrelated regression, fulfilling the additivity property between biomass components. Diameter and total height were explored as independent variables. All models included tree diameter whereas for the majority of species, total height was only considered in the stem biomass models and in some of the branch models. The comparison of the new biomass models with previous models fitted separately for each tree component indicated an improvement in the accuracy of the models. A mean reduction of 20% in the root mean square error and a mean increase in the model efficiency of 7% in comparison with recently published models. So, the fitted models allow estimating more accurately the biomass stock in hardwood species from the Spanish National Forest Inventory data.

AB Ecological features and conservation requirements of populations at the latitudinal limits of a species geographical range frequently differ from those in other parts of the range. Identifying such differences is key to implementing effective conservation strategies for threatened range-edge populations especially, in the context of rapid global warming, at the lower-latitude range edge. We studied habitat selection and diet of the endangered Cantabrian Capercaillie Tetrao urogallus cantabricus in a recently discovered population at the southernmost edge of the sub-species range. This is the only Western Capercaillie population in the Mediterranean biogeographical region. We combined non-systematic surveys based on questionnaires, reports and field sampling with data from radiotracking to assess habitat selection. Diet was surveyed by micro-histological methods from droppings collected in the new population, which inhabits Pyrenean Oak Quercus pyrenaica forests and Scots Pine Pinus sylvestris plantations, and in two Cantabrian populations inhabiting Eurosiberian forests. Capercaillie preferred large (> 500 ha) and medium-sized (100500 ha) Pyrenean Oak forest fragments and large Scots Pine plantations. Forest fragments smaller than 100 ha and non-forested habitats were always avoided. Diet differed markedly between Mediterranean and Eurosiberian populations. Bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus is common in the diet of most Capercaillie populations but was scarce in the study area and so was rare in the diet of the new population. Instead, Rockrose Halimium lasianthum was described for the first time as a major food resource for the Capercaillie and was consumed in autumn and winter. Pine needles were also heavily consumed in winter. We document for the first time the strong preference of Capercaillie for Pyrenean Oak forests and a moderately high consumption of the leaves, buds and acorns of this tree species throughout the year. Habitat selection and diet of this Mediterranean population differ from those of the core Cantabrian and other populations. Our results suggest a wider environmental tolerance (phenotypic plasticity) in the species than previously recognized. We advocate specific protection for this unique range-edge Capercaillie population and its Pyrenean Oak forest habitat.

AB Wood of Quercus pyrenaica has suitable properties for the wine ageing process. However, the forest available for the barrel making from this particular type of tree is very limited. Nevertheless, it is highly advisable to use this kind of wood in order to manufacture alternative oak products. This study presents the results of ageing the same red wine using different pieces of wood (chips and staves) of Spanish oak (Q. pyrenaica), American oak (Quercus alba) and French oak (Quercus petraea) in conjunction with small, controlled amounts of oxygen. In addition, the phenolic parameters, colour and sensory analysis point out that wines aged with Q. pyrenaica pieces have similar enological characteristics to those aged with American or French oak pieces of wood (chips and staves). Furthermore, the total oxygen consumed and its relation with sensory properties also has been studied in this article in order to know how the oxygen behaves in these processes. Besides, it is going to put forward the fact that chips and staves from Q. pyrenaica oak are suitable for the ageing of red wines and better considered than American or French ones, showing higher aromatic intensity, complexity, woody, balsamic and cocoa. Finally, the tasters valued highly the wines with staves, pointing out its flavour and roundness in mouth.

TI Metabolism of Oak Leaf Ellagitannins and Urolithin Production in Beef

AB Oak leaves have a high concentration of ellagitannins. These phytochemicals can be beneficial or poisonous to animals. Beef cattle are often intoxicated by oak leaf consumption, particularly after suffering feed restriction. The severity of the poisoning has recently been associated with the ruminal microbiota, as different bacterial populations were found in animals that tolerated oak leaves and in those that showed clinical and pathological signs of toxicity. Intoxication has previously been linked to the production of phenolic metabolites, particularly catechol, phloroglucinol, and resorcinol. This suggested that the microbial metabolism of ellagitannins could also be associated with its tolerance or intoxication in different animals. Therefore, it is essential to understand the metabolism of ellagitannins in cattle. Here we show that ellagitannins are metabolized in the cattle rumen to urolithins. Different urolithins were detected in ruminal fluid, feces, urine, and plasma. Oak leaf ellagitannins declined as they were converted to urolithins, mainly isourolithin A and urolithin B, by the ruminal and fecal microbiota. Urolithin aglycons were observed in rumen and feces, and glucuronide and sulfate derivatives were detected in plasma and urine. Sulfate derivatives were the main metabolites detected in plasma, while glucuronide derivatives were the main ones in urine. The main urolithins produced in cattle were isourolithin A and urolithin B. This is a relevant difference from the monogastric mammals studied previously in which urolithin A was the main metabolite produced. Low molecular weight phenolics of the benzoic, phenylacetic, and phenylpropionic groups and metabolites such as catechol, resorcinol, and related compounds were also detected. There was a large variability in the kinetics of production of these metabolites in individual animals, although they produced similar metabolites in all cases. This large variability could be associated with the large variability in the rumen and intestine microbiota that has previously been observed. Further studies are needed to demonstrate if the efficiency in the metabolism of ellagitannins by the microbiota could explain the differences observed in susceptibility to intoxication by the different animals.

AB Water availability and salt excess are limiting factors in Mexican mixed pine-oak forest. In order to characterise the acclimatation of native species to these stresses, leaf water (Psi(w)) and osmotic potentials (Psi(s)) of Juniperus flaccida, Pinus pseudostrobus and Quercus canbyi were measured under natural drought and non-drought conditions under two different aspects in the Sierra Madre Oriental. Factorial ANOVA revealed significant differences in Psi(w) and Psi(s) between two aspects, species and sampling dates. In general, all species showed high predawn and low midday values that declined progressively with increasing drought and soil-water loss. Seasonal and diurnal fluctuation of Psi(w) and Psi(s) were higher for J. flaccida and Q. canbyi than for P. pseudostrobus. Leaf Psi(w) and Psi(s) were mainly correlated with soil water content, while Psi(s) of P. pseudostrobus were hardly correlated with environmental variables. Thus, species have different strategies to withstand drought. P. pseudostrobus was identified as a species with isohydric water status regulation, while J. flaccida and Q. canbyi presented water potential patterns typical for anisohydric species. The type of water status regulation may be a critical factor for plant survival and mortality in the context of climate change. Nevertheless, for precise conclusions about the advantages and disadvantages of each type, further long-term investigations are required.

AB The composition of volatile and semi-volatile compounds of chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) was studied and compared to oak wood species frequently used in cooperage (Quercus alba, Quercus petraea, Quercus robur and Quercus pyrenaica) to evaluate its aromatic potential. Chestnut was found lobe a suitable wood for use in ageing processes, based on the large, diverse number of detected compounds (e.g., lactones, furanic compounds, terpenes, lignin derivatives and triterpenic compounds). Chestnut wood possessed high levels of volatile phenols and phenolic aldehydes, specifically vanillin and its derivatives. Each wood species exhibited a characteristic, quantifiable composition of volatile compounds, and therefore, the sensorial profile of each wood species is expected to be different. The levels of certain volatile compounds were also useful for discriminating among the studied wood species. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nitrous oxide fluxes ranged from -11.43 to 8.34 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) in Q.ilex, -7.74 to 13.52 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) in Q. pyrenaica and -28.17 to 21.89 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) in P. sylvestris. Fluxes of CH4 ranged from -8.12 to 4.11 mu g CH4-C m(-2) h(-1) in Q.ilex, -7.74 to 3.0 mu g CH4-C m(-2) h(-1) in Q. pyrenaica and -24.46 to 6.07 mu g CH4-C m(-2) h(-1) in P. sylvestris. Seasonal differences were detected; N2O fluxes being higher in wet months whereas N2O fluxes declined in dry months. Net consumption of N2O was related to low N availability, high soil C contents, high soil temperatures and low moisture content. Fire decreased N2O fluxes in spring. N2O emissions were closely correlated with previous day's rainfall and soil moisture. Our ecosystems generally were a sink for methane in the dry season and a source of CH4 during wet months. The available water in the soil influenced the observed seasonal trend. The burned sites showed higher CH4 oxidation rates in Q. ilex, and lower rates in P. sylvestris. Overall, the data suggest that fire alters both N2O and CH4 fluxes. However, the magnitude of such variation depends on the site, soil characteristics and seasonal climatic conditions.

AB Soil and dominant species of 4 trophic positions were sampled in 13 non-polluted oak woodlands. Primary producers were represented by oak (Quercus robur or Q. pyrenaica), primary consumers by mice (Apodemus sylvaticus), secondary by shrews (Sorex granarius), and detritivores by slugs (Anion ater). Cadmium, Co, Cr, Hg, Ni and Pb were determined in composite samples from each level. There were not close significant relationships among the compartments, and a low degree of overlap among the levels of metals in the compartments, showing biomagnification for Cd. For the studied heavy metals, a common accumulation pattern among the different levels was found: productors < primary consumers < detritivores < secondary consumers. For most of the studied levels, the range of concentrations found was wide including, in some cases, the concentrations found in polluted sites from other studies. This high bioaccumulation variability must be taken into account when comparing polluted and unpolluted sites.

AB Due to the European Habitats Directive, Quercus pyrenaica habitat has been protected within the Natura 2000 network for biodiversity conservation. Many of these habitats have been widely managed as coppice forest with silvopastoral use throughout Spain. Currently, in many of these oak coppices fuelwood extraction is neglected and grazing is the main use. Management plans required in the Directive should consider all these circumstances and offer an integrated approach to ensure a favourable conservation status of these habitats. We propose a three phase methodology to assess the ability of the habitat to support a given livestock density annually and seasonally, and to evaluate some of the physical impacts of grazing animals on the physical structure and development of the habitat. We applied the methodology to a neglected coppice forest that supports livestock at different periods. Results show that there is a possible compatibility between annual livestock food requirements and pasture production. Current grazing periods seem to fit the seasonal pasture productivity. Negative impacts were assessed on oak shrubland stands due to intense browsing and on low polewood owing to the high density of broken trees. On more developed stands, positive livestock impact was due to the control of the regrowth of coppice shoots. Acorn absence is a result of the previous coppice management. This negative impact may endanger long-term viability of Q. pyrenaica in the study area. We propose a process of conversion into high forest through a sequence of thinning to start sexual regeneration. In this proposal, livestock have an important role to ensure biodiversity, control the regrowth of coppice shoots and thinning low polewood stands. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Aboveground litterfall from Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd. a semi-deciduous species), mixed Pyrenean oak-pine and pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forest stands was surveyed in two sites in a Mediterranean mountain area during a period of 36 and 29 months, respectively. Separation in different litterfall fractions was performed, and C content of each fraction was measured to calculate the C flux to the soil due to litterfall. Our results showed that litterfall input was higher in pine stands than in Pyrenean oak stands (1.8-2.4 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) at pine plots and 0.9-1.4 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) at oak plots) and mixed plots showed intermediate values. Needles or leaves contributed about 50% to total litterfall, underpinning the importance of the rest of materials in the soil C input. The seasonal pattern showed a maximum in Pyrenean oak stands in autumn-early winter, while the pine stands had the maximum in summer, which is in consonance with the physiology of fall of broadleaves and coniferous trees in these latitudes, but clearly differs from needle-shed in Central and Northern Europe. A dry-spring year corresponded to a lower leaf fall during the following autumn, and leaf abscission came some weeks earlier than a year with a rainy spring.

AB We investigated how richness and composition of vascular plant species in the understory of a mixed hardwood forest stand varied with respect to the abundance and composition of the overstory. The stand is in central Spain and represents the southernmost range of distribution of several tree and herbaceous species in Europe. Understory species were identified in 46 quadrats (0.25 m(2)) where variables litter depth and light availability were measured. In addition, we estimated tree density, basal area, and percent basal area by tree species within 6-m-radius areas around each plot. Species richness and composition were studied using path analysis and scale-dependent geostatistical methods, respectively. We found that the relative abundance of certain trees species in the overstory was more important than total overstory abundance in explaining understory species richness. Richness decreased as soil litter depth increased, and soil litter increased as the relative proportion of Fagus sylvatica in the overstory increased, which accounted for a negative, indirect effect of Fagus sylvatica on richness. Regarding understory species composition, we found that some species distributed preferentially below certain tree species. For example, Melica uniflora was most frequent below Fagus sylvatica and Quercus petraea while the increasing proportion of Q. pyrenaica in the overstory favored the presence of Cruciata glabra, Arenaria montana, Prunus avium, Conopodium bourgaei, Holcus mollis, Stellaria media and Galium aparine in the understory. Overall, these results emphasize the importance of individual tree species in controlling the assemblage and richness of understory species in mixed stands. We conclude that soil litter accumulation is one way through which overstory composition shapes the understory community.

AB The ability of plants to increase their net CO2 assimilation rate in response to increased irradiance is due to morphological and physiological changes, which might be related to their shade tolerance and leaf ontogeny, but few studies have considered morphology and physiology. Two sympatric oak species (the shade-tolerant Q. petraea and the comparatively shade-intolerant Q. pyrenaica) were grown in hydroponic solution in low-light (LL) and high-light (HL) conditions. 5 months after leaf expansion under these conditions, half of the LL plants were transferred to high light (TLH). Transfer of Q. pyrenaica, from low- to high light led to photoinhibition and after 21 days in higher light there was little acclimation of the maximum rate of carboxylation (V-Cmax) or the maximum rate of electron transport (J(max)). Q. pyrenaica TLH plants showed lower stomatal conductance at all times compared to plants growing in LL. Stomatal closure was the main limitation to photosynthesis after transfer in Q. pyrenaica. The increase in evaporative demand upon TLH did not affect hydraulic conductivity of Q. pyrenaica. In contrast, the more shade-tolerant Q. petraea showed a greater degree of acclimation of gas exchange in TLH than Q. pyrenaica and two weeks after transfer gas-exchange rates were as high as in LL plants. In Q. petraea, the most important changes occurred at the level of leaf biochemistry with significant increase in V-Cmax that decreased the J(max)/V-Cmax ratio below values recorded in HL plants. However, this potential increase in photosynthesis was at least partially hamstrung by a decrease in internal conductance, which highlights the importance of internal conductance in acclimation to higher light in mature leaves. Neither oak species reached the photosynthetic rates of HL plants; however a trend towards leaf acclimation was observed in Q. petraea while the transfer was harmful to the leaves of Q. pyrenaica developed in the shade.

AB Stand composition and structure of natural mixed-oak stands of common-oak (Quercus robur L) and pyrenean-oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) were studied. Diverse compositional and structural elements in early and late successional stand stages were analysed. The study was conducted in north and central Portugal where different natural mixed oak forests types are located. The following mixed-oak forest types involving common-oak and pyrenean-oak were studied: common-oak & other hardwoods; common-oak & cork-oak (Quercus suber L); ash (Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl) & pyrenean-oak; and pyrenean-oak & madrone (Arbutus unedo L). Measurements were made in early and late successional stand stages on the different mixed oak forest types. Different stand characteristics and indices were used to describe and compare stand structure and composition. The study showed changes in species diversity and stand structure. Most tree species in mature stands are present in early stages but with higher abundance. Shannon diversity index may change between 0.798 and 1.915. Significant differences on species diversity and abundance were found depending on the forest type and successional stage. Mature mixed-oak forests have high species diversity with an abundance of small to medium tree size species. Species distribution and diameter differentiation indices range from 0.30 to 0.70 and 0.52 to 0.82, respectively, revealing significant structural complexity. The average number of standing and downed dead trees was 265 and 83 trees ha(-1) for early and late stage, respectively, with 6.9 and 65.4 m(3) ha(-1). Higher values of stand diversity index were 41 and 53 in more complex and developed forests. Later stand stages have complex structure, with a wider range of tree diameter distribution and higher degree of irregularity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We compared soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and stability under two widely distributed tree species in the Mediterranean region: Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L) and Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyre mica Willd.) at their ecotone. We hypothesised that soils under Scots pine store more SOC and that tree species composition controls the amount and biochemical composition of organic matter inputs, but does not influence physico-chemical stabilization of SOC. At three locations in Central Spain, we assessed SOC stocks in the forest floor and down to 50 cm in the mineral in pure and mixed stands of Pyrenean oak and Scots pine, as well as litterfall inputs over approximately 3 years at two sites. The relative SOC stability in the topsoil (0-10 cm) was determined through size-fractionation (53 mu m) into mineral-associated and particulate organic matter and through KMnO4-reactive C and soil C:N ratio.
   Scots pine soils stored 95-140 Mg ha(-1) of C (forest floor plus 50 cm mineral soil), roughly the double than Pyrenean oak soils (40-80 Mg ha(-1) of C), with stocks closely correlated to litterfall rates. Differences were most pronounced in the forest floor and uppermost 10 cm of the mineral soil, but remained evident in the deeper layers. Biochemical indicators of soil organic matter suggested that biochemical recalcitrance of soil organic matter was higher under pine than under oak, contributing as well to a greater SOC storage under pine. Differences in SOC stocks between tree species were mainly due to the particulate organic matter (not associated to mineral particles). Forest conversion from Pyrenean oak to Scots pine may contribute to enhance soil C sequestration, but only in form of mineral-unprotected soil organic matter. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB We compared the structure of the arboreal layer and the diversity and species composition of the understory vegetation of three types of mature forest communities: oak (Quercus pyrenaica) and beech (Fagus sylvatica) forests and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) plantations. Our main aim was to determine whether differences in these variables existed and were due to the identity of the dominant tree species. We selected four stands or replicates per forest type located geographically close and with relatively similar conditions. We found no differences in the arboreal structure of oak and beech forests, which were characterised by great variability in tree size, while in case of plantations, this variability was lower at both the intra-stand (estimated by the coefficient of variation) and inter-stand (i.e. the four replicates harboured trees of similar sizes) scales. However, the highest variability in the canopy layer of natural forests was not consistently linked to greater understory species richness. Indeed, the lowest plant species richness was found in beech forests, while oak forests harboured the highest value at either the sampling unit (per m(2)) or stand scales. The greatest negative correlation between plant diversity and the environmental variables measured was found for litter depth, which was the highest in beech forests. The results obtained by the CCA indicated that the four replicates of each forest type clustered together, due to the presence of characteristic species. We concluded that pine plantations did not approach the environmental conditions of native forests, as plantations were characterised by singular understory species composition and low arboreal layer variability, compared to natural woodlands.

AB The great spatial and temporal heterogeneity of Mediterranean ecosystems can influence establishment success in woody species, whose natural regeneration occurs to a very small extent. In this work, the effect of the spatial pattern of environmental variables (light availability, soil moisture and herbaceous production) on seedling emergence, growth, survival and establishment success was examined by using a spatially explicit approach.
   Seeds of four Quercus species differing in leaf longevity (Quercus ilex, Quercus suber, Quercus faginea and Quercus pyrenaica) were sown in two plots located in a holm oak forest (southern Spain). The spatial pattern of the studied variables was examined by Spatial Analysis by Distance Indices.
   All environmental variables exhibited an aggregated spatial pattern. There was no clear spatial association between the environmental variables and emergence and survival. Only soil moisture during the dry season was spatially associated with the establishment success of all the species. Species also differed in survival and establishment success, with evergreens having higher percentages than deciduous. No aggregated spatial pattern for growth and morphological traits was apparent, these being more dependent on seed mass than on environmental factors. Identifying which microsites facilitate regeneration may provide useful hints with a view in focusing restoration endeavours on microenvironments with high survival percentage.

ID QUEBRACHO TANNIN; TOXICOSIS; SHEEP
AB Three experiments were conducted to study the clinical and pathological findings associated with poisoning in cattle due to ingestion of young oak leaves (OL) and the main factors responsible for toxicosis. In Experiment 1, six 1.4 year-old bulls were fed up to 5 kg of young OL per animal per day and showed no signs of toxicity, apart from a slight proteinuria. In Experiment 2, another six 1.4 year-old bulls were first subjected to severe feed restriction for eight days and then fed a higher amount of OL (approx. 10 kg) daily. A marked increase of serum creatinine and blood urea (BUN) was detected in urine as well as clinical signs consistent with renal failure. At necropsy, animals showed gastrointestinal ulcers and kidney tubular necrosis. Since these results suggested a crucial role of the feed restricting period, a third experiment was conducted administering the same amount of young OL as in Experiment 1, but adding the severe feed restricting period as in Experiment 2. There was a wide variation in clinical signs, with one bull showing clinical signs and lesions, another recovering after showing mild clinical signs and high levels of creatinine and BUN, and the third appearing clinically normal. The relevance of restriction access to food in the development of OL toxicosis appears to be critical because the intoxication was only elicited when the OL administration was preceded by a severe feed restricting period.

AB The size of seeds and the microsite of seed dispersal may affect the early establishment of seedlings through different physiological processes. Here, we examined the effects of seed size and light availability on seedling growth and survival, and whether such effects were mediated by water use efficiency. Acorns of Quercus petraea and the more drought-tolerant Quercus pyrenaica were sowed within and around a tree canopy gap in a sub-Mediterranean forest stand. We monitored seedling emergence and measured predawn leaf water potential (Psi(pd)), leaf nitrogen per unit area (N-a), leaf mass per area, leaf carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) and plant growth at the end of the first summer. Survival was measured on the next year. Path analysis revealed a consistent pattern in both species of higher delta C-13 as Psi(pd) decreased and higher delta C-13 as seedlings emerged later in the season, indicating an increase in C-13 as the growing season is shorter and drier. There was a direct positive effect of seed size on delta C-13 in Q. petraea that was absent in Q. pyrenaica. Leaf delta C-13 ad no effect on growth but the probability of surviving until the second year was higher for those seedlings of Q. pyrenaica that had lower delta C-13 on the first year. In conclusion, leaf delta C-13 is affected by seed size, seedling emergence time and the availability of light and water, however, leaf delta C-13 is irrelevant for first year growth, which is directly dependent on the amount of seed reserves.

We aimed to identify the environmental conditions that favour or hamper the establishment success of these species. In spring 2008, seeds of the studied species were sown under an experimental gradient of light (100, 65, 35, 7% of full sunlight) combined with three levels of soil moisture (mean soil water potential = -0.97, -1.52 and -1.77 MPa.). During the first growing season we monitored seed emergence and seedling survival. We found that the effect of light on the establishment success was stronger than the effect of soil moisture. Both exotic and native species of central Spain showed a good performance under high light, A. negundo being the most shade tolerant. Water shortage diminished E. angustifolia and A. altissima success. Among NW Spain species, A. dealbata and P. pinaster were found to be potential competitors for colonizing high-irradiance scenarios, while Q. pyrenaica and E. globulus were more successful under moderate shade. High soil moisture favoured E. globulus but not A. dealbata establishment. These results contribute to understand some of the factors controlling for spatial segregation between coexisting native and exotic tree species, and can help to take decisions orientated to the control and management of these exotic species.

AB Changes of the structure of a community of Spheciformes wasps (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) along a 15 year recovery gradient after wildfires in a Mediterranean agroecosystem are reported and analysed. The species that contribute to determining the structure, change in dominance amongst the most abundant species, and variation in guild structure of the community with the passage of time since fire, as well as the environmental variables contributing to the structure of the community are also analyzed. Mediterranean Spheciformes communities are highly resistant to fire. The sampling year, representative of different climate conditions, and the time since the fire, were the main variables which affected community variation local conditions of the habitat was more important than time since fire in determining community. Local conditions; presence of trophic resources, nesting sites, and presence of prey for feeding the larvae, depended on climatological conditions and the time since fire. Variations were detected in the dominance values of the most abundant species, together with displacements among species within the same genus, as a function of the local conditions, the existing resources, and the time since the wildfire. Therefore, change in community structure cannot be attributed solely to the effect of the fire, as both climatic and environmental conditions contribute to community structure.

AB Soil enzyme activities were performed in three permanent no-till and unfertilised plots located in the South of Salamanca province (Spain), the first in a Castanea sativa Mill. paraclimax coppice (CC), the second in a chestnut orchard (CO) and the third in a Quercus pyrenaica Wild, climax forest (Oak), adjacent to the CO plot.
   We hypothesized that the activities of dehydrogenases, ureases, acid phosphatases, arylsulphatases and beta-glucosidases in different forest ecosystems are involved in the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling and we report their relationship with each other and with physical, chemical and general biochemical parameters of the soils. The main aim of the study was to detect biological criteria for sustainable development in natural degenerate forests of Mediterranean Europe. For this, we used sweet Chestnut (C. sativa Mill) and Oak Q pyrenaica Wild as models to better define the ecological conditions of these natural resources in terms of nutrient balance, physiology and biological diversity of their communities, to relate them to the conditions of exploitation and land-use changes, for the characterization of sustainable ecological systems.
   Furthermore, soil respiration was high and significantly different in the chestnut coppice stand than the other two stands, chestnut orchard and oak.
   Correlations between soil biochemical and soil microbiological variables showed that the three different forest management practices had also a strong effect on soil function conditions. In a discriminate analysis. CC and Oak were discriminated clearly, while CO was in the middle of the biplot sharing some properties with each of the two different groups. Thus, we proposed a soil property transition from the best soil structure and function properties at one chestnut management properties with low tree densities (CC and CO) to other with the worst ones at highest tree density conditions (Oak). According to natural soil conditions in Oak, we assumed that most of the enzyme activities reached their highest levels at highest C and N soil contents but at lowest soil base saturation percentage while they were not at all associated with P soil availability.

AB For the current study, the volatile and semi-volatile composition of several samples of Quercus pyrenaica wood from NW Spain were analyzed and compared. The research was performed on a wide sample set of more than 100 samples (test tubes) obtained from different stands of this species. The relationship between some silvicultural and site parameters and volatile composition was studied. Altitude seemed to be the most influential parameter on the volatile composition. However, other factors such as distance from tree center, average annual precipitation, and number of trees per hectare whose effects on the volatile compounds were not significant. The influence of soil texture was not a determining factor while geographical location seemed to have a more specific impact on the extractive volatile content. The content of all extractable compounds studied allowed a good separation of oak samples of the same species according to their geographical origin. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Secondary cavity-nesting birds (SCN), which cannot create their own breeding cavities, are expected to be influenced by habitat alteration caused by forest management practices, but the mechanisms underlying the distribution pattern of SCN subjected to different management systems are poorly known. To improve our knowledge on these mechanisms, we examine cavity abundance, cavity occupation and reproductive performance of SCN in Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) forests subjected to two management systems: (i) dense "young forests", maintained at such stage by clear-cuttings and burns, and (ii) "old forest", subjected to extensive traditional grazing and scarce firewood extraction by selective cutting. Young forests had considerably lower density of cavities (1.29 +/- 0.71 vs 15.09 +/- 2.00 cavities ha(-1)). SCN species (0.18 +/- 0.11 vs 0.61 +/- 0.07 species ha(-1)) and nests (0.40 +/- 0.27 vs 2.67 +/- 0.25 nests of all SCN ha(-1)) than old forests, indicating that a low availability of cavities may limit SCN assemblages in young oak forests. However, reproductive parameters of great (Pants major) and blue (Cyanistes caeruleus) tits associated with the availability of food (laying date, clutch size, nestling number and weight, adult weight) did not differ between both forest types, suggesting that food supply was not reduced in young forests, at least for tits during the breeding season. Large diameter (up to 170 cm dbh) decayed trees were the most likely to hold cavities, but birds preferred smaller living cavity-trees for nesting (90% of nests in 21-65 cm dbh trees). The preservation of cavity-trees within traditionally managed old oak forests is crucial in providing nesting opportunities to SCN. Besides, the protection of these traditionally managed forests would also benefit to other forest organisms that depend on old and open oak forests. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work was designed to assess the nutritional influence of pre-incubation in saliva on in vitro fermentative activity when some tanniniferous shrubs were incubated in batch cultures of mixed ruminal microorganisms. Saliva was collected from eight Merino sheep allocated in two experimental groups, namely control (SC) and quebracho (SQ) groups fed one kg alfalfa hay daily. Sheep of SQ group were given daily alfalfa hay supplemented with 50 g quebracho/kg dry matter for 60 days, whereas sheep of SC group were always given unsupplemented alfalfa hay. Foliage of six shrub species (Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom), Genista florida (Iberian silver-leaved broom), Rosa canina (wild dog rose), Quercus pyrenaica (hoary oak), Cistus laurifolius (laurel-leaved rock-rose) and Erica australis (Spanish heath)) was collected from uplands in the province of Leon (Norwest Spain) in spring and in summer/autumn and used in the study. Samples were pre-incubated in each saliva source for 4 h at 39 degrees C, followed by an incubation in buffered rumen fluid to determine their in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVD) and gas production kinetics. For all treatments, rumen fluid was obtained from sheep of control group. Regardless the large differences among the plant browse species used in the study in their tannin contents, IVD and rate and extent of degradation (based on gas production parameters), there were no significant differences between SC and SQ saliva in any of the variables studied. Accordingly, it was suggested that sheep supplemented with quebracho tannins did not produce salivary proteins to protect against negative effects of tannins on digestion of plant material, and that the feedback mechanism may not have evolved or may have become lost. Further studies on the effect of tannins on saliva chemical composition in sheep would be timely. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; BALANCE; STOCKS
AB The main mixed forest species in Portugal are pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton) and oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.). Forests are an important carbon stock in a global scale. Portugal has about 3 million of hectares of forest (30% of the territory) so it is essential to understand the function of these ecosystems and especially how the water and nutrients cycles work in order to estimate the carbon sequestration and ecosystems productivity during climate changes.
   Ecophysiological models are often used to make scenarios of future carbon dynamics under different conditions, to monitor the ecosystems and to estimate variables such as net primary production (NPP). NPP is a key variable for ecological studies because allows us to monitor the impact of climate change on ecosystems. This is particularly important towards meeting Kyoto Protocol and subsequent meetings requirements, as the annual NPP represents the carbon net amount fixed by plants through photosynthesis each year.
   The object of this study is to assess the accuracy of the process-based biogeochemical model Forest-BGC for application in northeastern of Portugal forests. This kind of model offers a methodology to evaluate physiological variables in a quick and cheaper way than possible in field work. To analyze the Forest-BGC performance, NPP data obtained with the model was compared with data collected in the field, using the same sampling plots. To validate the model Forest-BGC and estimate the carbon dynamics, this study was based on 46 sampling plots with 500m(2) from the National Forest Inventory (NFI) 2006: 19 pure plots with pine stands, 17 pure plots with oak and 10 mixed plots of oak with pine. Adaptation strategies for climate change impacts can be proposed based on these research results.

AB The saproxylic beetle Cetonia aurataeformis Curti (Scarabaeoidea: Cetoniidae) is a common Iberian species, whose larvae develop in tree cavities feeding on wood and litter. The aim of this paper is to analyse how the larvae of this cetonid modify the woody substrate by feeding and what the ecological implications on their microhabitat could be. Thermal analysis and infrared spectroscopy have been used to study the changes suffered by different substrates, litter and wood of Betula alba and Quercus pyrenaica, after digestion by the larvae. Results show that larvae of C. aurataeformis are able to digest polysaccharides and lignin producing a residue richer in nutrients than the original substrate and with an organic structure that contains a fraction of lignin that is easier to decompose. The main conclusion is that the action of cetonid larvae on woody substrates could facilitate their use by other saproxylic organisms in natural ecosystems.

AB Plants of one evergreen oak (Quercus Hex) and three deciduous oaks (Q. faginea, with small leaves; Q pyrenaica and Q robur, with large leaves) were exposed both to filtered air and to enhanced ozone levels in Open-Top Chambers. Q. faginea and Q. pyrenaica were studied for the first time. Based on visible injury, gas exchange, chlorophyll content and biomass responses, Q. pyrenaica was the most sensitive species, and Q. ilex was the most tolerant, followed by Q. faginea. Functional leaf traits of the species were related to differences in sensitivity, while accumulated ozone flux via stomata (POD1.6) partly contributed to the observed differences. For risk assessment of Mediterranean vegetation, the diversity of responses detected in this study should be taken into account, applying appropriate critical levels. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB P>1. Successful seed dispersal by animals is assumed to occur when undamaged seeds arrive at a favourable microsite. Most seed removal and dispersal studies consider only two possible seed fates, predation or escape intact. Whether partial consumption of seeds has ecological implications for natural regeneration is unclear. We studied partial consumption of seeds in a rodent-dispersed oak species.
   2. Fifteen percent of dispersed acorns were found partially eaten in a field experiment. Most damage affected only the basal portion of the seeds, resulting in no embryo damage. Partially eaten acorns had no differences in dispersal distance compared to intact acorns but were recovered at farther distances than completely consumed acorns.
   3. Partially eaten acorns were found under shrub cover unlike intact acorns that were mostly dispersed to open microhabitats.
   4. Partially eaten acorns were not found buried proportionally more often than intact acorns, leading to desiccation and exposure to biotic agents (predators, bacteria and fungi). However, partial consumption caused more rapid germination, which enables the acorns to tolerate the negative effects of exposure.
   5. Re-caching and shrub cover as microhabitat of destination promote partial seed consumption. Larger acorns escaped predation more often and had higher uneaten cotyledon mass. Satiation at seed level is the most plausible explanation for partial consumption.
   6. Partial consumption caused no differences in root biomass when acorns experienced only small cotyledon loss. However, root biomass was lower when acorns experienced heavy loss of tissue but, surprisingly, they produced longer roots, which allow the seeds to gain access sooner to deeper resources.
   7.Synthesis. Partial consumption of acorns is an important event in the oak regeneration process, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Most acorns were damaged non-lethally, without decreasing both dispersal distances and the probability of successful establishment. Faster germination and production of longer roots allow partially eaten seeds to tolerate better the exposure disadvantages caused by the removal of the pericarp and the non-buried deposition. Consequently, partially consumed seeds can contribute significantly to natural regeneration and must be considered in future seed dispersal studies.

AB Systematic relationships of the two most widespread oaks in Armenia, Quercus iberica M. Bieb. and Quercus macranthera ssp. macranthera Fisch. Mey. ex Hohen. (Fagaceae), were examined by means of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence variation. The analysis included recently published and several newly derived ITS fragments of most common Eurasian Quercus spp. Orthology of sequences was supported by inspection of ITS secondary structure features. Analyses were implemented with parsimony and maximum likelihood criteria to check the position of all taxa. The robustness of the phylogenetic hypothesis was tested with bootstrap, decay, and Bayesian analysis. Three main clades emerged from the root, corresponding to subg. Quercus, Cerris, and Sclerophyllodrys. Q. iberica and Q. macranthera were included in the subg. Quercus clade and related to Quercus petraea and Q. frainetto-Q. pyrenaica, respectively. The taxonomical status of Q. iberica (Q. petraea ssp. iberica according to some authors) was analysed with respect to Q. petraea. Despite the strict phylogenetic relationship among these two species, the genetic distance (Kimura) was compatible with the hypothesis of maintaining the two taxa separated. A hypothesis on the differentiation of Q. iberica and Q. macranthera before the last glaciation, and their subsequent re-expansion from glacial refugia located in the southern shores of the Black Sea, is proposed. Q. petraea ssp. huguetiana (sequenced for the first time in this study) turned out to be an outgroup with respect to the clade formed by the other accessions of Q. petraea (including Q. iberica). On this basis, this taxon could also assume specific status. The phylogenetic position of Q. pyrenaica is discussed for the first time.

AB Tree mortality is an important process in forest ecosystem dynamics and is one of the least understood phenomena, because of the complex interactions between different environmental stresses, minimal understanding of whole-plant mortality processes, and a chronic shortage of data.
   A multilevel logistic regression model was developed for predicting the probability of mortality in individual trees with the objective of improving long-term planning in Spanish pyrenean oak forests. The data came from one 10-year re-measurement of the permanent plot network belonging to the Spanish National Forest Inventory distributed throughout north-west Spain.
   The probability of mortality decreased with increasing individual diameter at breast height and increasing ratio of the height of subject tree to the dominant height of the sample plot. The resulting mortality model was evaluated using an independent data set from a region close to the study area.
   The regeneration of pyrenean oak generally takes place through stump and/or root sprouting; so stand dynamics differ from those of others species. The model developed is expected to improve the accuracy of stand forecasts in northwest Spain.

AB To evaluate leaf physiological mechanisms involved in plant tolerance to water deficit between sites of varying overstorey density, we investigated leaf water relations of two broadleaved oaks (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. and Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) planted within a dense Scots pine stand, in a thinned adjacent area and in a nearby gap at a Mediterranean, mid-mountain field site. Leaf water parameters were estimated in established seedlings at the end of June and August over two consecutive years by measuring pressure-volume relationships with the pressure chamber technique. Plant water status was always similar in both species, and it was lower in August than June due to lower soil moisture at the end of summer. Higher light and diurnal water deficits in the gap were associated to more negative osmotic potentials. Impacts of overstorey density on some leaf water parameters depended on the species. While Q. pyrenaica showed active osmotic adjustment across sites, seedlings of Q. petraea were unable to cope with increased water deficit by osmotic adjustment in the unthinned dense area. While Q. pyrenaica showed consistent increases in the maximum bulk modulus of elasticity (epsilon(max)) from June to August across sites, epsilon(max) decreased in the unthinned dense area for seedlings of Q. petraea. These results could reflect distinct species strategies to cope with water deficit under the low-light conditions created by a dense overstorey. Higher leaf osmotic adjustment and bulk modulus of elasticity in Q. pyrenaica seedlings at peak summer drought might confer on them a competitive advantage during establishment in dry sub-Mediterranean understories. Opening of moderate canopy gaps in dense Scots pine stands improves some leaf mechanisms involved in drought tolerance in oak seedlings.

AB We described an extension of the known distribution range of the Cantabrian Capercaillie Tetrao urogallus cantabricus into an atypical area and habitat for the species. Nine Capercaillie leks and 14 cocks were registered in Mediterranean Quercus pyrenaica forests in an area of 1,500 km(2), of which 4,500 forest hectares were surveyed. At present, this population represents both the southern-most distribution for Capercaillie and the only one inhabiting Mediterranean Q. pyrenaica forests, what suggests a wider adaptation of this (sub)species than previously thought. This population and its habitat need to be better studied, as well as to be considered in conservation planning for Cantabrian Capercaillie.

AB The volatile composition of the different oak wood pieces (chips of Quercus spp.) that can be found on the market to be used as alternatives to barrels for aging wines, as well as of chips of Quercus pyrenaica which are being introduced, was studied, evaluating the contents of volatile phenols, lactones, furanic compounds, pyranones, phenolic aldehydes, phenolic ketones, and others. In regard to the overall results, the volatile composition of these products varies widely and has not been clearly laid out according to either the oak species or the wood toasting intensity. Taking into account that the different characteristics of alternatives to barrel products are reflected in the wine treated with them and that an oenological profile based on these variables (origin and toasting level) cannot be defined, only an appropriate chemical analysis would reveal the quality of alternative-to-barrel products and allow us to attempt to foresee its effects on the chemical and organoleptic characteristics of the wines treated with them. On the other hand, the Q. pyrenaica alternative products are very similar to those of other species, with some aromatic particularities, such as their high levels of furanic compounds, eugenol, Furaneol, and cis-whiskylactone, and low levels of vanillin.

AB Soil compaction and light availability influence plant growth via different mechanisms. In general, soil compaction has a direct effect on roots, whereas light affects leaves and stems. Although plants in nature are exposed to variable levels of soil compaction and light, no study on the potential mutual interactions of these limiting factors in woody plants has to the authors' knowledge been reported to date. The aim of this work was therefore to elucidate the effects of soil compaction and light availability on growth and biomass allocation in the deciduous oak Quercus pyrenaica. To this end, a study was conducted at two light levels (viz. 3% and 100% of incident light, designated as low-light and high-light, respectively) under a wide range of soil compaction (0.02-3 MPa as penetration resistance) in a greenhouse. Total biomass was found to be positively affected by both light and soil compaction. There was marginally significant interaction between the effects of the two factors on total biomass, which was positively affected by soil compaction only under high-light conditions. Soil compaction had a strong, negative effect on the length of the main root; thus, at maximum soil compaction, such a length was roughly one-half that observed at lower compaction levels. Also, the specific root length of main root (root length to root mass ratio) was reduced by roughly one-half in highly compacted soils. These results suggest that an unfavourable combination of soil compaction and light availability may have severely adverse effects on woody plant performance in drought periods since plants with short roots can hardly access water at deep soil levels. The strength of this effect may be modulated by light availability. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bechstein's bat (Myotis bechsteinii) is one of the rarest European bat species. In oceanic climates, they appear to be restricted to woodlands, with preference for mature deciduous forests in lowlands. We investigated habitat selection by 20 lactating females belonging to 13 maternity colonies in Mediterranean landscapes. Deciduous forests (particularly Quercus pyrenaica) were positively selected, and coniferous forests were opportunistically used, whereas no foraging bouts occurred in evergreen broadleaved woodlands or in non-forested areas. Bats preferred to forage inside the forest rather than in edges or clearings. Stands of high canopy cover were also preferred. The preference for deciduous over evergreen broadleaved woodlands suggests that other variables such as prey availability, rather than structural constraints, drive habitat selection. M. bechsteinii might be abundant in well preserved deciduous forests within its Mediterranean range, in which the species' distribution might be limited by habitat loss and degradation related to agricultural practices and deforestation.

AB In Central-Western Spain, forests and woodlands composed of Quercus sp. support outstanding levels of biodiversity, but there is increasing concern about their long-term persistence due to a lack of regeneration. We hypothesize that this regenerative lack is operating on a large geographic scale; that there are differences in the abundance of regeneration between three oak species; that oak regeneration is governed mainly by forest management and structure; and that shrubs act as important physical protectors of seedlings and saplings. We analyzed whether densities of oak seedlings and saplings in several size classes were related to stand-structure, understory, and physiographic variables potentially affecting regeneration. Data collected at a regional level (1 km x 1 km grid) by the Spanish Forest Inventory were evaluated from 2,816 plots. Results revealed that regeneration failure was common for all size categories, from small seedlings to large saplings, and for the three oak species studied, especially the evergreens. Of the Quercus ilex, Q. suber, and Q. pyrenaica plots studied, 49%, 62%, and 20% were lacking any small seedlings, and 82%, 96%, and 56% did not have any large saplings, respectively. Regeneration was positively correlated with tree cover and density, especially of small and medium-sized trees, and negatively correlated with the presence of large trees, indicating that regeneration failure is mostly associated with more open, uniform, and/or aged woodlands. Regeneration densities of Q. ilex and Q. suber were positively correlated with all understory variables, suggesting that the presence of pioneer shrubs represent a major safe site for early tree recruitment, independent from specific shrub species.

AB The main goal of Natura 2000 network is to guarantee the favourable conservation status of habitats and species ensuring European biodiversity. As a result, certain forest areas have been included in this network listed as 9230-Quercus pyrenaica habitat and 9340-Quercus ilex subsp. rotundifolia forest habitat. These areas were previously used for firewood extraction or livestock grazing and browsing. Nowadays these habitats are coppice forests with asexual regeneration, which is far from the desired conservation status. Traditional timber harvesting plans do not take account of the new objectives required for these Natura sites, which attempt to ensure biodiversity and recreational uses instead of simply focusing on timber production. This paper proposes a flexible methodology (applied to the study area "Dehesa Boyal" in Avila, Spain) for managing Natura 2000 forest sites by stands for sustainable forest management and the new requirements. The methodology has two phases. The first, "Division of the forest area into stands", defines homogeneous patches of vegetation distinct in species composition, physiognomic structure and future management. The second, "Conservation status assessment of stands", quantifies the conservation status of each previously classified stand considering a series of factors such as: functional health, restoration, floral richness and structure. A total value integrating the conservation status of stands is then calculated for the habitat. Both phases use Geographic Information System tools for managing information and visualizing results. The proposed methodology provides forest managers with a good knowledge of the territory and subsequently enables them to take appropriate conservation measures to maintain biodiversity.

TI Ingrowth model for pyrenean oak stands in north-western Spain using

AB In this paper, a two stage ingrowth model is presented for predicting periodic, 10 years ingrowth for pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) grown in medium to fully stocked coppice stands in north-western Spain. Data from the Spanish National Forest Inventory was used to develop the model, extracting the information from two inventories taken in 222 permanent plots. The first stage of the model predicts the probability of ingrowth occurrence, and in the second stage, the number of recruits is predicted using a conditional model. Both models were biologically realistic and presented logical behaviour. The ingrowth occurrence probability model was dependent on quadratic mean diameter and average height. The recruitment quantification model included stand density and average diameter as explanatory variables. Although the occurrence probability of ingrowth was predicted correctly in 71.7% of cases, the predictions of the number of recruitment are poorer, yielding a coefficient of determination of 0.358. The evaluation criteria included qualitative and quantitative examinations and a testing with independent data from another region. The proposed ingrowth model is the first to be developed for mediterranean oak species in Spain and is an essential feature in any stand growth system.

AB To assess the effects of altitude on the level and structure of genetic diversity, a genetic survey was conducted in 12 populations of sessile oak (Quercus petraea) located between 130 and 1660 m in two parallel valleys on the northern side of the Pyrenees Mountains. Genetic diversity was monitored at 16 nuclear microsatellite loci and 5 chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) markers. The cpDNA survey suggested that extant populations in both valleys shared the same source populations from the plain. There was no visible trend of nuclear genetic diversity along altitude, even if indirect estimates of effective population sizes revealed a consistent reduction at higher altitudes. Population differentiation, although low, was mostly present among populations of the same valleys and reached similar levels than differentiation across the range of distribution of sessile oak. Contribution to the overall differentiation in the valleys was mostly due to the genetic divergence of the highest populations and the altitudinal variation of allelic frequencies at a few loci. Bayesian inference of migration between groups of populations showed that gene flow is preferentially unidirectional from lower altitudes in one valley to other groups of populations. Finally, we found evidence of clonal reproduction in high altitude populations. The introgression of Quercus robur and Quercus pubescens was also more frequent at the altitudinal margin suggesting that this mechanism may have contributed to the present migration and adaptation of Q. petraea and may also facilitate its future upslope shift in the context of climate change.

AB The aim of this work was to study and describe fungal communities in different habitats in dry Mediterranean areas. The objective was to determine whether artificial reforestations can develop fungal communities as productive and diverse as those found in natural stands. The results could provide ecological and economical implications for forest management in marginal areas, in order to recover the original forest dominated by Quercus, establishing as intermediate stage new forest stands dominated by Pinus which might play an essential role in restoring some type of degraded or marginal areas.
   Reforestations in degraded soils in abandoned farmlands were dominated by Pin us pinaster, P. sylvestris and P. halepensis whereas natural forest stands were dominated by Quercus pyrenaica, Q. faginea and Populus nigra. During the autumn mushroom season of 2003, fruiting bodies found in the plots were identified, and production, mycological richness, diversity were measured.
   Individual sporocarps (7841), classified into 136 taxa, were collected and classified according to functional groups (mycorrhizal and saprotrophic), edibility, as well as commercial importance in the study area. In Pinus plots, sporocarps collected (4506), were classified into 84 different taxa, 32 mycorrhizal and 52 saprotrophic. Eleven of the total collected taxa were classified as edible fungi; and 8 of them are marketed in the studied area. In Quercus plots, 1277 sporocarps were collected, classified into 46 taxa, 17 mycorrhizal and 29 saprotrophic fungi. Eleven species were edible and four marketed in the region. In Populus plots, 2058 sporocarps were classified into 28 taxa. Seven were classified as mycorrhizal and 21 as saprotrophic. Twelve were classified as edible fungi; and four species are marketed in the area.
   Differences were found for richness variables, comparing mean values for host genus. Thus, values in Pinus plots were higher than in Quercus plots. In relation with fungal production, an average plot yield of 340.51 kg ha(-1) fresh weight was found in Pinus plots. Fresh weight average plot production was 56.6 kg ha(-1) and 226.2 kg ha(-1) in Quercus and Populus plots respectively. Fresh weight production of edible taxa was found to be higher in Pinus and Populus plots than in Quercus stands.
   Artificial reforestations play an essential role in Mediterranean ecosystems avoiding soil losses and desertification of large areas in order to recover the original forest. They also may provide fungal production and diversity as high as those found in natural forest stands. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Above-ground tree biomass and total amounts of nutrients in biomass were estimated at two plots: the first in a Castanea sativa Mill. paraclimax coppice and the second in a Quercus pyrenaica (Wild.) climax forest, both of them located in the south of the Salamanca (Spain), by harvesting 10 trees at each plot. In order to obtain the best fit possible, for these analyses, four regression equations were applied: linear, logarithmic, potential and exponential. In the chestnut coppice, the best fits were obtained using the exponential regression, while for the oak plot the best fit was obtained with the linear regression. A parametric analysis was also performed for each fraction of the tree biomass between both plots. This revealed that, total biomass and that of the trunks, branches and leaves at the chestnut coppice were significantly greater than those found at the oak plot. At the chestnut coppice for the nutrients (except carbon) significant differences were observed between leaves, branches and trunks, the highest concentrations being found in the leaves, followed by the branches and the trunks. This order was also observed at the oak plot, with the exception of calcium, which did not reveal significant differences between the branches and the trunks.

AB Question
   What is the relative importance of seed mass and abiotic factors in species-specific seedling growth and morphology during the first and the second growing season? How do oak species respond along gradients of these factors?
   Location
   Mediterranean oak forest in southern Spain.
   Methods
   We analysed seedling growth components and morphology of three co-occurring Quercus species (two deciduous and one evergreen). Oak seeds with a wide variety of sizes were sown along broad gradients of abiotic conditions. Intra- and inter-specific differences were evaluated by calibrating maximum likelihood estimators of seedling growth during the first two years of life.
   Results
   We found multiple resources and conditions affecting seedling morphology and biomass allocation. However, the integrative variables of seedling growth - total aboveground biomass and relative growth rate (RGR) - were affected by two main factors: seed mass and light conditions. The relative contribution of these two factors depended strongly on seedling age. Seed mass explained most of the growth and morphological variables during the first year, while light conditions were the best predictor in the second growing season. In contrast, soil factors did not play an important role in seedling growth. We found some evidence of regeneration niche partitioning between oak species along the light gradient, a reflection of their distribution patterns as adults at the study site.
   Conclusions
   We conclude that inter-specific differences in seedling growth, arising from seed size variability and microsite heterogeneity, could be of paramount importance in oak species niche segregation, driving stand dynamics and composition along environmental gradients.

AB Flash floods may influence the development of trees growing on channel bars and floodplains. In this study, we analyze and quantify anatomical reactions to wounding in diffuse-porous (Alnus glutinosa L.) and ring-porous (Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl. and Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) trees in a Mediterranean environment. A total of 54 cross-sections and wedges were collected from trees that had been injured by past flash floods. From each of the samples, micro-sections were prepared at a tangential distance of 1.5 cm from the injury to determine wounding-related changes in radial width, tangential width and lumen of earlywood vessels, and fibers and parenchyma cells (FPC). in diffuse-porous A. glutinosa, the lumen area of vessels shows a significant (non-parametric test, P-value <0.05) decrease by almost 39% after wounding. For ring-porous F. angustifolia and Q. pyrenaica, significant decreases in vessel lumen area are observed as well by 59 and 42%, respectively. Radial width of vessels was generally more sensitive to the decrease than tangential width, but statistically significant values were only observed in F angustifolia. Changes in the dimensions of earlywood FPC largely differed between species. While in ring-porous F angustifolia and Q. pyrenaica the lumen of FPC dropped by 22 and 34% after wounding, we observed an increase in FPC lumen area in diffuse-porous A. glutinosa of similar to 35%. Our data clearly show that A. glutinosa represents a valuable species for flash-flood research in vulnerable Mediterranean environments. For this species, it will be possible in the future to gather information on past flash floods with non-destructive sampling based on increment cores. In ring-porous F. angustifolia and Q. pyrenaica, flash floods leave less drastic, yet still recognizable, signatures of flash-flood activity through significant changes in vessel lumen area. In contrast, the use of changes in FPC dimensions appears less feasible for the determination of past flash-flood events as these two species do not react with the same intensity and clarity as A. glutinosa.

AB The extent to which seedling recruitment is limited by summer drought in Mediterranean-type ecosystems depends on the light microsite, yet the relationship between light availability and water status, functional performance, and survival of seedlings in these systems is still unclear. Over a 3-year period, we studied the pattern of survival and functional performance of seedlings of Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. and Quercus pyrenaica Willd. in a montane forest in central Spain, which is the southern edge of the natural range of Q. petraea. After a mast year of the two species, 72 plots were established in six microhabitats spanning a range of overstorey canopy closure: closed, partial and open canopies dominated by either Q. petraea or Q. pyrenaica adult trees. Seedlings of each species naturally emerged beneath the conspecific-dominated canopies. The second and third years of study were extremely dry. Three years after emergence, the greatest seedling survival occurred beneath the partial canopy of Q. pyrenaica trees (8%) and the lowest (0%) beneath the closed canopies of Q. pyrenaica and Q. petraea. Survival for Q. pyrenaica increased linearly with understorey light across the range of 10-35% Global Site Factor. Plant water deficit (estimated by leaf water potential) was high across microhabitats, and increased with light availability for Q. pyrenaica. Potential for photosynthesis (estimated by the electron transport rate of photosystem II) decreased with canopy closure; and potential for light harvesting (e.g. specific leaf area (SLA) and chlorophyll concentration) increased with closure. Extreme water deficit could be the main contributor to seedling death in the more open microhabitats, whereas light level was insufficient to maintain carbon balance under the water-stressful conditions existing beneath the closed tree canopies. Seedling establishment appears to be a limiting factor for the recruitment of both oaks within this forest in a wide range of microhabitats, especially for the more drought-sensitive Q. petraea. Moderate reductions of tree canopy cover can improve seedling establishment, but extreme summer droughts can prevent the success of any silvicultural practice made.

AB The practice of wine aging in stainless steel tank involves storing wine in contact with wood and dosing it with small oxygen quantities in order to obtain a final wine more stable in time and with the same characteristics of barrel-aged wines. Oxygen dosing is a key factor and, to achieve a correct development of wine, needs to be applied according to wine necessities and to the kind of wood chosen. This paper shows the results obtained from the study of oxygen required by a same wine aged in tanks with different alternative products (chips and staves) made of American (Q alba), French (Q. petraea) and Spanish oak (Q. pyrenaica), with a strategy of micro-oxygenation as required. The results indicate that the size and origin of the wood used determine the oxygen management during the process. In fact, wine treated with big pieces (staves) consumes more oxygen and, with regard to wood origin, wine aged with French oak (Q. petraea) products needs of a higher oxygen dosage.

AB The increasing demand for wood for barrel-making in addition to the rapid extension of alternative aging system, have led to looking into the possibility of utilizing Spanish oak. Quercus pyrenaica is the species that predominates in Spain, and the chemical composition of its heartwood (ellagitannins, low molecular weight phenolic and volatile compounds) and its incidence in characteristics of wine are similar to that of other species that are of recognized oenological quality for barrel-making, showing only quantitative differences with respect to French (Quercus petraea) and American (Quercus alba) species. However, at present, the quantity of good quality wood that we can obtain from the Q pyrenaica Spanish forest is limited. Hence, in the short term, and considering the high chemical oenological quality of Q pyrenaica wood, we propose the utilizing of chips, segments, staves, and other oak alternatives for wine aging, which would be obtained from wooden remnants from barrel-making as well as from trees with small diameters or physical defects which would normally be inappropriate for cooperage. With regards to the latter idea, studies on special chip-making processes, and other oak wood pieces are being carried out, especially focused on reducing seasoning time, and to toasting optimization as a function of wood piece size. in addition to its behaviour when incorporated into the different alternative aging systems. We present in this study the effect of seasoning way (traditional or unconventional) on volatile composition of Q pyrenaica chips and staves at three toasting levels (light, medium and heavy), and the evolution of the wood-released aromatic composition of a Spanish artificially aged wine, using these alternative products. The wines showed in general small differences in their oak-derived characteristics, which were more related to the wood piece size and the toasting intensity than to the seasoning way, and they could be linked with the concentrations of compounds as eugenol, furfural, and the cis and trans isomers of beta-methyl-gamma-octolactone.

AB The evolution of the wood-released aromatic composition of a Spanish wine artificially aged with chips and staves of Spanish oak (Quercus pyrenaica), French oak (Quercus petraea), and American oak (Quercus alba) was studied by GC MS. The volatile composition of the oak wood was also studied. The wines aged with Spanish Q. pyrenaica oak evolved similar to those with French and American oak, with slight differences in their oak-derived characteristics. The size of the wood pieces appeared to influence the volatile composition of the wines more than the oak species. Nevertheless, each type of wood and piece size showed particular extraction kinetics. Wines aged with chips become stable after 70 days of contact with the wood, showing standardization after longer times. The wines aged with staves evolved during the entire contact length and in the bottle. This evolution occurred slowly, probably because of the slowness of wine penetration into the wood, the concentration gradient between wine and wood, and the important contribution of the compounds that toasted staves can provide. In general, the differences in oak-related volatile compounds among wines were those expected, taking into account the volatile composition of the woods used to age wine, and they confirm the importance of analyzing the volatile composition of oak wood pieces before contact with wine. The wine treated with Spanish oak had more cis-beta-methyl-gamma-octalactone and eugenol than the same wine treated with French and American oak, especially when staves were used.

AB Intoxication of grazing cattle occurs repeatedly when they consume large amounts of young oak leaves (OL), which are rich in hydrolysable tannins (HT), due to a shortage of other feed resources. The HT are antimicrobial, although some rumen bacteria can resist or degrade them into potentially toxic or harmless metabolites. To study the effect of the administration of HT-rich OL (Quercus pyrenaica) after a severe feed restriction on the rumen bacterial community and monitor the variations in some bacterial groups that are potentially able to resist or metabolise tannins, three ruminally cannulated bulls were initially fed grass hay and then subjected to a severe 8-day feed restriction period, before receiving OL for 6 days. Then, the animals were again offered grass hay for 12 more days. Rumen contents were sampled throughout the experiment. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism were used to monitor the bacterial dynamics. Animal 1 was not intoxicated and showed lower relative abundances of Streptococcus bovis initially and after the OL administration than Animals 2 and 3, which showed acute signs of intoxication. The genus Prevotella increased its abundance with the OL administration, whereas Selenomonas ruminantium was reduced. The bacterial terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism profile of Animal 1 clustered initially separately from Animals 2 and 3 and was less affected by the feed restriction period. These results showed that the effect of the consumption of HT-rich OL after a severe feed restriction is highly variable in cattle and might rely on the individual composition of the microbiota colonising the rumen.

AB The potential of a chlorophyll meter (CCM-200, Opti-Sciences, Tyngsboro, MA, USA) for the estimation of total leaf chlorophyll contents was evaluated in leaves of different developmental stages for Quercus pyrenaica Willd., Q. faginea Lam., Q. suber L. and Q. ilex L. subsp. ballota (Desf.) Samp.
   For all species and leaf stages, a strong non-linear relationship (P < 0.0001) was found between the chlorophyll content index (CCI) and leaf chlorophyll content per unit area. In all species, the slope of the CCI-chlorophyll content relationship varied during leaf development, suggesting that caution should be exercised when using the CCM-200, since the interpretation of CCI readings should be limited to samples of similar leaf age. Also, the data indicate that the models should also be species-specific, owing to differences in the intercept and/or slope of the equations.
   The addition of fresh LMA as a complementary parameter improved the accuracy of chlorophyll estimation in non-species-specific equations to a considerable extent when leaf samples of similar development were considered.
   After due consideration, it may be concluded that the CCM-200 chlorophyll meter is a reliable method for acquiring an estimation of chlorophyll contents in Mediterranean Quercus species, with potential use as an effective tool in forest management.

AB Data from stem analysis of 56 dominant trees of Quercus pyrenaica Willd., in natural stands in Galicia (NW Iberian Peninsula), were used to evaluate four dynamic site equations derived with the Generalized Algebraic Difference Approach (GADA). All the equations are base-age invariant and directly estimate height and site index from any height and age. The fittings were made using a data structure involving all possible growth intervals. The GADA formulation derived on the basis of the Bertalanffy-Richards model by considering the asymptote and the initial pattern parameters as related to site productivity. It is therefore recommended for height growth prediction and site classification for natural stands of rebollo oak in Galicia. The autocorrelation was analyzed with a test of residuals using Durbin's t-test without reaching a manifest result of autocorrelation between managed data.

AB Light availability and herbivory are 2 major factors affecting the regeneration of woody species, and thus a better perception of how light and herbivory interact to shape the sapling performance of cohabitant tree species emerges as a key issue. The purpose of this work is to experimentally analyze the influence of light conditions on tree responses to browsing. We evaluated the responses to browsing (simulated by mechanical clipping of 50% of current-year shoots) of saplings from 2 deciduous (Acer opalus ssp. granatense and Quercus pyrenaica) and 2 evergreen (Quercus ilex and Pinus nigra ssp. salzmannii) late-successional tree species, measuring an array of morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits. The experiment was performed with saplings grown for 2 y under 3 experimental light environments emulating natural microhabitats: full (open microhabitats), 80% (below pioneer shrub canopy), and 13% (below tree canopy) sunlight. Clipping affected biomass distribution, growth, and sapling size, while only slight physiological and biochemical effects were detected. Species characteristics and the light environment in which saplings grow determine their capacity to recover biomass lost after herbivore damage. Black pine was found to be the least tolerant species to clipping, whereas the broadleaf species displayed greater recovery after clipping. Light scarcity increased the nutritional quality of plants and negatively affected herbivory tolerance of 3 of the 4 species.

AB We aimed to study tree effects on the chemical properties of forest soils. We compared soil features of three types of forest ecosystems, each with four stands (replicates): beech forests (Fagus sylvatica), oak forests (dominated by Quercus pyrenaica) and pine plantations (Pinus sylvestris). Five samples from the top 10 cm of soil were taken per stand, from which pH, organic matter content (O.M.), total nitrogen (N) and available calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) were determined. Litter layer depth was measured at each soil sampling point. We also measured tree density and crown diameters at each stand. Our results indicated that soil samples from the four pine plantation stands were more similar while oak and beech stands were characterised by great variability in terms of soil properties and leaf litter depth. Although the identity of the dominant tree species significantly influenced several topsoil chemical properties (increase in pH and available cations in oak forests and higher organic matter and total nitrogen in beech and pine ecosystems), there were other important factors affecting soil features that may be taken under consideration. Differences between soil properties of the three types of forest ecosystems were mainly related to the characteristics of the litter layer and less related to the tree layer structure. Finally, the establishment of pine plantations in naturally deciduous tree areas made the topsoil features more homogeneous.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of forest structure (mainly resulting from human uses) and forest type (the identity of the dominant tree species) on biodiversity. We determined the diversity of two taxonomical groups: the understory vegetation and the edaphic carabid beetle fauna. We selected eight types of forest ecosystems (five replicates or stands per forest type): pine (Pinus sylvestris) plantations of three age classes (10, 40 and 80 years since reforestation), an old-growth relict natural pine forest, and four types of oak (Quercus pyrenaica) stands: mature forests with livestock grazing and firewood extraction, mature forests where uses have been abandoned, "dehesa" ecosystems and shrubby oak ecosystems. The results obtained by a global PCA analysis indicated that both tree size and dominant species influenced the ordination of the 40 forest stands. In general, carabids were more sensitive to changes in forest heterogeneity and responded more clearly to the analysed structural variables than the understory vegetation, although the species richness of both groups was significantly correlated and higher in case of oak forests. Pine forest ecosystems were characterised by the lowest species richness for both taxonomical groups, the lowest plant diversity and by the lowest coefficients of variation and, consequently, low structural heterogeneity. As a result, it was very difficult to discriminate the effects of the spatial heterogeneity and the dominant tree species on biodiversity.

AB The purpose of this research was to study the influence of the vegetation on the soil C pool of forests of pines (Pinus sylvestris) and oaks (Quercus pyrenaica), located in Central-Western Spain. Horizons from selected soils located in these forests were sampled, and the soil organic C (SOC) was determined. In addition, in vitro incubation experiments were carried out, under controlled conditions, to monitor the stability of SOC against the microbial activity. Soil humus fractions were isolated following a classical procedure of chemical fractionation using alkaline solutions, before and after the incubation experiment. A deeper O horizon was found under the pine forest than under oak one; however, higher SOC content was found in the oak site than that under pine one. During the in vitro mineralization process, a lower CO(2) production by the soil sample from pine forest was observed, in relation to that emitted by the oak soil. In addition, a lower humification degree was estimated for the soil humus under pines than for that under oaks. In conclusion, replacement of oaks by pines produced a decrease in SOC accumulation and a lower quality of humus in the forest soils.

AB Following a review of all the available Iberian material belonging to the genus Ferdinandea Rondani, 1844, results show that the fauna of the Iberian Peninsula have all the four species recorded in the Palaearctic region: F. aurea Rondani 1844, F. cuprea (Scopoli, 1763), F. fumipennis Kassebeer, 1999, and F. ruficornis (Fabricius, 1775). Examined material of F. ruficornis represents the first record from the Iberian Peninsula. A revised key to the Iberian Ferdinandea species is provided, as well as updated distribution maps for each of the species. Breeding sites for F aurea and F ruficornis are reported, in the case of F. aurea as the first known (in Quercus faginea and Quercus pyrenaica), and in the case of F ruficornis as the first in Q. pyrenaica. Special attention should be paid to the conservation of F ruficornis, highly restricted in its Iberian range and threatened with extinction in different European countries.

AB Destruction and fragmentation of habitats represent one of the most important threats for biodiversity. Here, we examined the effects of fragmentation in Mediterranean forests on the epiphytic lichen Lobaria pulmonaria (Lobariaceae). We tested the hypothesis that not only the level of fragmentation affects L. pulmonaria populations, but also the quality of the habitat and the nature of the surrounding matrix affect them. The presence and abundance of the lichen was recorded on 2039 trees in a total of 31 stands. We recorded habitat quality and landscape variables at three hierarchical levels: tree, plot, and patch. We found that L. pulmonaria tends to occur in trees with larger diameters in two types of surveyed forests. In Quercus pyrenaica patches, the mean diameter of colonized trees was smaller, suggesting the importance of bark roughness. Factors affecting the presence and cover of the lichen in each type of forest were different. There was a strong positive influence of distance from a river in beech forests, whereas proximity to forest edge positively affected in oak forests. The influence of the surrounding matrix was also an important factor explaining the epiphytic lichen abundance.

AB Leaf morphological variation was examined in recruits of two hybridising oaks in a small sympatric area from Central Spain. Nuclear microsatellites were used to identify hybrids and assess the parental lineage. By Bayesian clustering analysis, 5% of hybrids were found. Principal component analysis was used to reduce 15 morphometric variables to four components associated with leaf size, lobation/pubescence and overall shape of the leaf. The percentage of variance due to genetic factors was evaluated through nested analysis of variance. As much as 70% of variance component was due to the factor "species" for lobation/pubescence, suggesting high adaptive value for these traits, possibly related to ecological constraints of the species. The genetic component of variance for leaf size and overall shape of the leaf was below 33%. Age and height of the recruits did not correlate with sun-leaf morphology. Competition indexes and diameter of the recruits showed slight, although significant, correlations with leaf size and lobation/pubescence components, pointing to some trade-offs between competition for light and leaf morphology of Q. petraea and Q. pyrenaica recruits.

AB In Southern Europe there are vast areas of forestry land which are composed of Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica). However, these areas represent an important source of biomass which can be used for energetic purposes. The maintenance of the Pyrenean oak woodland is carried out by means of the extraction of complete trees, having a final residue made of very different types of branches that can influence on the properties of the pellets. The present work shows the results obtained from the characterization and analysis of different types of pelletized residues of the Pyrenean oak. The results have been classified in order to find out if different pretreatments for the residues, according to their branch size, are necessary. Nevertheless, any significant difference was found among the three classes of samples. On the other hand, during the pelletization of the different types of branches some of their physical characteristics, such as the bulk density, were substantially improved. However, the chemical characteristics of the samples were not significantly altered during this densification process. Furthermore, the pellets showed interesting physical resistance probably due to the high percentage of lignin present in forest biomass which improves their durability. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Several samples were collected during the archaeological excavations at the proto-historic and Roman settlement of Terronha de Pinhovelo, northeast Portugal, in order to obtain plant macrofossils. The relevant archaeobotanical data gathered from the Roman structures of Sector B at the site allow a further understanding of the settlement and its community's daily life between the 4th and 5th centuries A.D. In the charcoal analysis, the main types recovered were Pinus pinaster, Quercus pyrenaica type, Q. faginea type, Q. suber type, Arbutus unedo and Fraxinus angustifolia. The shrubs, significantly less abundant in the samples, were represented by Cistus sp., Leguminosae and Erica spp. It must be stressed that the samples were taken from well-delimited domestic hearths and the botanical remains result from specific choices of firewood in short episodes of time, and therefore not the most appropriate for palaeoecological approaches, which usually cover a longer time span. The cereals are the most frequent group of plants represented in the fruit and seed assemblages. Triticum aestivum/durum, T. compactum, T spelta and Hordeum. vulgare were the dominant crops, followed by T dicoccum and Panicum miliaceum. The only pulse identified was Vicia faba var. minor, in quite abundant quantity although it came almost exclusively from just one hearth. Two of the compartments sampled seem to be directly connected to plant processing, but the presence together of several plant taxa in the domestic structures makes their understanding quite difficult. These palaeo-economic data are consistent with the records already available for northwest Iberia, and are significantly representative of a regular Romanised rural community.

AB The use of acacia wood for the aging of vinegars is increasing because the efficient air transfer through the pores permits a good acetification rate. In this study, vinegars aged in acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia) wood barrels were analyzed and found to contain a characteristic compound, which increased during the aging process. This so far unknown compound was isolated by semipreparative LC and structurally identified by NMR spectroscopy. H-1 and C-13 NMR chemical shifts and optical rotation revealed its structure to be (+)-dihydrorobinetin, a dihydroflavonol identified for the first time in vinegars as a marker of aging in this kind of wood. This study also reports for the first time the complete assignment of C-13 NMR data for this compound. Moreover, it revealed a longer contact time with acacia wood results in higher concentrations of (+)-dihydrorobinetin found in vinegars. Another finding was that the vinegars aged with nontoasted acacia chips showed significantly higher concentrations of (+)-dihydrorobinetin than found in vinegars aged with toasted acacia chips (384.8 and 23.5 mg/L, respectively). The in vitro antioxidant activity (DPPH center dot and ORAC assays) of (+)-dihydrorobinetin was also determined. (+)-Dihydrorobinetin is reported here for the first time as a chemical marker of vinegars aged in acacia wood and can be used for authenticity purposes.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the effect of bedrock, mean annual precipitation and slope orientation on soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation of Quercus pyrenaica Willd forests. Twelve different oak stands, along a rainfall gradient over two bedrock types (granites and schists), were selected for this study. Properties of the diagnostic soil horizons were determined. Bedrock type was the principal factor affecting soil development and fertility. Accumulated SOC varied between 33 and 185 Mg C ha(-1), the amounts of C accumulated over schists being significantly higher than over granites because of higher soil acidity, 'silt + clay' content and metal complexation. The SOC content in the entire profile was over 125 times higher than the C accumulated in the stand forest litter at the schist sites and 50 times higher at the granite sites. Soil acidity and metal complexation hampered microbial decomposition of soil organic matter, producing SOC accumulation and forming thick umbric Ah/AB-horizons, being thicker at sites with high values of mean annual precipitation than at sites with low ones. Mineral N release was low in these soils. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Under climate change, severe and recurrent droughts can reduce forest production and cause widespread tree dieback. The response of different vegetation types to climate change can vary greatly and, therefore, must be individually assessed. This study was carried out in a Mediterranean oak forest (Quercus pyrenaica) subject to seasonal summer drought. To examine the response of the forest to the climate conditions predicted under climate change, a Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer model [SPA, Williams, M., Rastetter, E.B., Fernandes, D.N., Goulden, M.L, Wofsy, S.C., Shaver, G.R., Melillo, J.M., Munger, J.W., Fan, S.M., Nadelhoffer, K.J., 1996. Modelling the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum in a Quercus-Acer stand at Harvard Forest: the regulation of stomatal conductance by light, nitrogen and soil/plant hydraulic properties. Plant, Cell, Environment 19, 911-927] was used. The model was parameterized using mostly local measurements (independent of the verification data) and tested against in situ sap flow measurements obtained during year 2007. The predictions of the model were broadly consistent with the observed dynamics of sap flow (the model explained 71% of the variance in daily transpiration and 75% of half-hourly sap flow), leaf water potentials and soil water content. Once the model had been validated, simulations were carried out under warmer and dryer conditions. Predicted warmer conditions (4 degrees C) caused a moderate increase in total simulated transpiration. Less frequent precipitation (40% longer dry periods between rainfall events) had very little effect on transpiration. In contrast, transpiration was reduced by 17% when the soil water reserves at the beginning of the summer were lower than in 2007, corresponding to those measured in a very dry year (2005). The reduction was exacerbated when changes in temperature and rainfall were also considered (up to 28% decline in transpiration). The higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations (712 ppm) simulated together with climate change, did not prevent the decline in tree water use or soil water storage at the end of the summer. All scenarios caused the soil water storage to reach extremely low values at the end of the dry season (a minimum of 25 mm). It is concluded that climate change is likely to have a negative impact on tree water use and soil water resources in the study area, increasing the water deficit by as much as 30%.

AB The volatile composition of a red wine aged for 2 months with three different Spanish oak chips (Quercus pyrenaica and Quercus petraea) from different regions of Castilla y Leon was compared with that of wines aged with American and French chips. In general, the extraction kinetics showed that the maximum concentration of the volatile compounds extracted from wood can be reached in only 1 month. In the final wines, the levels of furanic aldehydes and eugenol were higher in the wines macerated with Spanish chips, whereas cis-whiskey-lactone, vanillin, and methyl vanillate showed higher levels in wines treated with American chips. Among the wines treated with the different Spanish chips, the differences observed in the volatile composition were more related to the geographical origin of the forest than to the botanical species. In general, the wines macerated with Spanish chips showed levels of oak-related volatile compounds that were more similar to those macerated with French chips than to those macerated with American chips.

AB In Mediterranean forestry, it is important to improve knowledge about mixed stands dynamics, including their productivity. Previous studies have focused on the interactions between different species (competition, reduction of competition and facilitation) depending on site, species composition and structure.
   At the centre of this research arc the possible differences between pure and mixed stands of Pinus sylvestris and Quercus pyrenaica in terms of density-growth relationships and volume growth per species.
   Using data from the second and third Spanish National Forest Inventory (606 plots), volume increment models for these species were fitted. Both species displayed a similar density-growth pattern for pure and mixed stands, with a maximum volume growth at maximum density. Volume increment per occupied area was also found to be greater in mixed stands as opposed to pure stands, suggesting a species interaction with reduced levels of competition in the former. However, the total volume growth was generally lower in mixed stands since the growth rate of oak is much lower.
   The results highlight the expedience of favouring P. sylvestris-Q. pyrenaica mixed stands with higher proportions of pine trees in order to gain the benefits of a more complex forest whilst retaining an acceptable level of wood production.

AB As a result of historical and ecological factors, woody-plant communities are composed of species with different biogeographic origins that presumably diverge in their ability to recruit under variable environments. The aim of this study is to evaluate the conservation implications of the differences in recruitment of six tree species of different biogeographical origin coexisting in a Mediterranean mountain forest. Under field conditions, we experimentally sowed a total of 16,650 seeds belonging to two Mediterranean (Quercus ilex and Q. pyrenaica), two Sub-Mediterranean (Acer opalus subsp. granatense and Sorbus aria), and two boreo-alpine (Pinus sylvestris and Taxus baccata) species. We selected the three most common successional scenarios where seeds are dispersed (woodland, shrubland, and open areas), and half of the seeds were irrigated simulating a rainy summer in terms of Mediterranean ecosystems. Seedling survival was strongly affected by the type of habitat as well as irrigation. The recruitment of the six species was possible only in wooded areas under wet conditions (20-60%). In shrubland, only Mediterranean and Sub-Mediterranean species recruited in typical dry years (10-50%), but irrigation increased their survival (25-65%) and allowed P. sylvestris to recruit (32%). Open areas constituted the most adverse scenario for seedling recruitment, especially for non-watered seedlings (0% for boreo-alpine species, 1-24% for the rest). Overall, the benefit of a wet summer was more critical for the recruitment of boreo-alpine species (P. sylvestris and T. baccata) than for the rest, although a rainy summer is also necessary for the recruitment of A. granatense and S. aria in shrubland habitats. Our experimental results indicate that the maintenance of current species composition in Mediterranean mountain forests is critically dependent on the periodic, scattered occurrence of wet summers. From a conservational standpoint, the predictions of less rainy summers and greater aridity in the future imply a change in the relative abundance of species in the mature forest, with Mediterranean species becoming dominant and boreo-alpine species becoming even rarer and, consequently, a serious threat for the persistence of boreo-alpine species at their southern distribution limit.

AB Soil water Saturation during prolonged periods of time generates a negative impact on nearly all terrestrial plants. In Mediterranean woodlands, precipitation can be very abundant during the wet season, inducing temporary soil waterlogging, coinciding with the seed dispersal and germination time of many species. We investigated the effects of waterlogging on seed germination and early root growth of three coexisting oak species (Quercus canariensis, Q. suber and Q. pyrenoica), by completely flooding of seeds for various periods of time. The three oak species showed a certain level of tolerance to waterlogging, only being affected those seeds subjected for long periods of submersion (over 30 days). Waterlogging during prolonged periods of time decreased the probability of seed germination in the three oak species, lengthened the time to germination, and hampered root development in two of the studied species. The main differences between oak species occurred in terms of root growth (Q. canariensis being the less affected, and Q. suber the most): these differential responses could be related to a species rank of waterlogging tolerance. Thus inter-specific differences in germination responses to waterlogging could contribute to explain, at least partially, species habitat and distribution patterns across landscapes. Seed mass also played an important role on different aspects of germination, though its relative importance varied as function of species and waterlogging treatment. The tolerance to stress induced by waterlogging increased with seed mass, but only in the case of Q. canariensis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Extracts of wood from acacia, European ash, American ash, chestnut, cherry, and three oak species (Quercus pyrenaica, Quercus alba and Quercus petraea) before and after toasting in cooperage were studied by GC-MS. 110 compounds were detected, and 97 of them were identified. In general, all studied woods showed more lignin derivatives than lipid and carbohydrate derivatives, with a higher variety of compounds detected and abundance of them. The toasting led to an increase in the concentrations of most of these compounds, and this increase is especially important in acacia, chestnut and ash woods. The cis and trans isomers of beta-methyl-gamma-octalactone and isobutyrovanillone were only detected in oak wood, 3,4-dimethoxyphenol and 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde only in acacia wood, and p-anisaldehyde and benzylsalicylate only in cherry wood, before and after toasting, and these compounds could be considered chemical markers for each one of these woods. Moreover, each wood has a characteristic volatile composition, from a quantitative point of view, and therefore we can expect a characteristic sensorial profile. The oak wood turned out to be the most balanced, since although it provides a lot of volatile compounds to the aroma and flavor of aged wine, it can do so without masking their primary and secondary aroma. On the whole, toasted acacia and chestnut woods showed a very high richness of studied compounds, as lignin as lipid and carbohydrate derivatives, while cherry and ash were much richer than toasted oak wood in lignin derivatives, but much poorer in lipid and carbohydrate derivatives.

AB The capacity of Phytophthora ramorum to colonize the inner bark of 18 native and two exotic tree species from the Iberian Peninsula was tested. Living logs were wound-inoculated in a growth chamber with three isolates belonging to the EU1 and two to the NA1 clonal lineages of P. ramorum. Most of the Quercus species ranked as highly susceptible in experiments carried out in summer, with mean lesion areas over 100 cm 2 in Q. pubescens, Q. pyrenaica, Q. faginea and Q. suber and as large as 273 cm 2 in Q. canariensis, ca. 40 days after inoculation. Quercus ilex ranked as moderately susceptible to P. ramorum, forming lesions up to 133 cm(2) (average 17.2 cm(2)). Pinus halepensis and P. pinea were highly susceptible, exhibiting long, narrow lesions; but three other pine species, P. pinaster, P. nigra and P. sylvestris, were resistant to slightly susceptible. No significant difference in aggressiveness was found between the isolates of P. ramorum. In addition, there was evidence of genetic variation in susceptibility within host populations, and of significant seasonal variation in host susceptibility in some Quercus species. The results suggest a high risk of some Iberian oaks to P. ramorum, especially in forest ecosystems in southwestern Spain, where relict populations of Q. canariensis grow amongst susceptible understory species such as Rhododendron ponticum and Viburnum tinus. One isolate of P. cinnamomi used as positive control in all the inoculations was also highly aggressive to Iberian oaks and Eucalyptus dalrympleana

AB Two experiments were conducted to study the effects of feeding young Pyrenean oak leaves (OLs) to beef cattle on in vitro ruminal fermentation. A total of 12 ruminally cannulated Brown Swiss bulls were divided into experimental groups that were fed different quantities of OLs via the ruminal cannula (on average 0, 2.5,5.2 and almost 10 kg fresh matter/animal per day; the treatments designated control, L-OL, H-OL and VH-OL, respectively). Batch cultures of rumen microorganisms and the in vitro gas production technique were used to study ruminal fermentation of two substrates (grass hay and OL) incubated with rumen inocula derived from each bull. Results showed not only a dose-dependent negative effect of feeding tannin-containing OL on ruminal fermentation of conventional feeds, such as the grass hay, but also improved fermentation of tannin-containing feeds, such as the OLs. in bulls fed moderate quantities of OLs (i.e., L-OL and H-OL), which suggests adaptation of the rumen microbial population. Detrimental effects of the VH-OL treatment indicate that the high level of tannins in the rumen of bulls on the highest dose of OLs would have exceeded the capacity of the microorganisms to resist or detoxify them.

AB The main objective of this work is to analyze the spatial and temporal response of Q pyrenaica community to fire. In order to do so, an ecological characterization of 15 forests in different succession stages (5 Initial: 0-20 years, 5 Medium: 20-60 years and 5 Mature: over 60 years), paying special attention to structural and diversity features, was carried out. The results show that temporal changes are very important, and particularly affect the structure and relative abundance of the vegetation. The main differences consist in the change from a homogenous structure, with high cover and overlayering of woody species, at Initial stage, to a more pluristratified, complex and organized structure, with lower cover and overlayering of woody species at Mature stage. The changes in abundances showed a decrease in shrubby species, such as the Erica australis, Genista florida and Erica arborea at Initial stage, and the incorporation of tree species, such as Crataegus monogyna, Acer pseudoplatanus and Alnus glutinosa at Mature stage. However, there are no significative differences between stages for specific richness and diversity values. Spatial heterogeneity is high and similar in all three defined stages.

AB Twenty-four samples of leaves. flowers and fruits of five browse plant species (i.e., Erica australis: Cistus laurifolius. Quercus pyrenaica Cytisus scoparius and Rosa canina) collected from spring to autumn at uplands in the province of Leon (NW Spain) were used to explore medium-term effects of intake of quebracho condensed tannins on fermentative activity in the rumen of sheep. The objective was to determine if adaptation to tannins at the rumen level may develop in response to regular consumption of tannins. resulting in an enhanced ability to digest browse forages. Eight rumen cannulated Merino sheep fed chopped alfalfa hay were used. Four sheep were fed alfalfa hay supplemented with 50g quebracho/kg dry matter (DM) for 60 days and used its the treated group (QT sheep). whereas the other sheep were always fed untreated alfalfa hay and used as the control group. Differences ill the fermentative activity were examined in vitro (DM digestibility (IVD) and gas production kinetics) in batch Cultures inoculated with rumen fluid obtained oil day 60 from both groups of sheep. With most browse samples. incubation in rumen fluid from QT sheep resulted in higher IVD, gas production at 24 h, fractional gas production rate and extent of degradation in the rumen compared with incubations in rumen fluid from control sheep. The magnitude of this effect was greater when browse with higher tannin content was incubated (leaves of E. australis and C. laurifolius). Rumen fluid from sheep fed a diet supplemented with condensed tannins had enhanced fermentative activity to degrade tannin-rich browse. which could be due to the appearance and proliferation of tannin-tolerant bacterial species and/or to stimulation of changes in the existing bacteria to enhance their tolerance to these phenolic compounds.

AB Quercus pyrenaica dehesas have been traditionally used as communal extensive grazing systems in the Leon province (NW Spain). In this region, recent abandonment of rural areas and the subsequent gradual decrease in livestock load have led to the invasion of shrubs in the understory, increasing the risk of fires. Indeed, even if there is no need of creating new pasturelands for livestock breeding, the remaining landowners keep on burning to clear these montane patches. Alternatively, the regional administration encourages shrub cutting as a better way of managing these areas and preserving the pasturelands. Our aim was to determine the effects of the dehesa abandonment and shrub cutting on plant species richness (annual herbs, perennial herbs and woody plants) and species composition, as well as on topsoil properties. For that, we compared three types of dehesas with different management regimes: (1) grazed dehesas (used at the present), (2) abandoned dehesas (more than 20 years without grazing) and (3) dehesas where shrub cutting was applied after abandonment (i.e. cleared dehesas). We selected three replicates or stands per dehesa type. The highest organic matter content (O.M.), total nitrogen (N) and available phosphorus (P) were found in cleared dehesas, while the lowest values corresponded to the grazed ones. Abandoned dehesas were characterized by the highest values for available calcium (Ca2+). No significant differences were detected regarding the vegetation richness values (S alpha, gamma or beta), although higher mean values of S alpha and gamma were found in grazed dehesas and lower, values in the cleared ones. Concerning the vegetation life forms, grazed dehesas held significantly greater species richness and cover of annual herbs, while abandoned dehesas had significantly higher woody species cover. Both grazed and abandoned dehesas harboured plant species (38 and 13 species, respectively), which were exclusively found in one dehesa type. Contrary to that, cleared dehesas scarcely had exclusive species. To conclude, our results indicated that shrub cutting alone (not followed by livestock grazing) may cause loss of plant species richness, suggesting that it is not the most appropriate management method to restore vegetation, except for reducing the risk of fire.

AB The mineral topsoil in 52 sites with different soil type under natural forests of Quercus petraea was studied in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. As a result of the anthropogenic influence, most of these forests are situated where the topography complicates their harvesting. The substrates are siliceous and the soils are mainly regosols. These soils are more frugal than soils under other oaks (Q. robur and Q. pyrenaica) that occupy the largest surface in the zone. The chemical properties were similar to those reported as the optimal for oak forests in the study area: pH very homogeneous, giving rise to typically acidic soils, disabling desirable conditions for humification, as verified by C/N ratio values and the presence of moder type humus. Although the base cations can be considered as high compared with Q. robur soils (except for copper), the phosphorus in the topsoil was clearly less (12.6 versus 21.8 ppm), indicating that these are mature forests that have not undergone changes in land use. Significant differences between soil types, chemical composition (pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and zinc) and topsoil fertility were observed. In the same way, the analysis of site conditions showed the existence of statistical differences with pH, zinc, C/N ratio, magnesium and copper content. The ecologic variables with the highest number of significant relationships with the topsoil parameters were altitude, annual precipitation and annual mean temperature.

AB Bechstein's bat (Myotis bechsteinu) is a European species, restricted to woodlands with preference for mature deciduous forests in lowlands. It is considered rare throughout its range, although it may be common in optimal habitats. Roosts play crucial roles in the ecology of bats, and survival is partially dependant on the extent to which roosts protect bats from environmental extremes and predators Roost selection is especially Important for reproductive females, due to the higher energetic demands Imposed by reproduction so understanding roost selection by maternity colonies is Important for conservation We Investigated maternity roost selection by M bechsteinu in southwestern Spain as a hierarchical process that proceeds from broad landscape scales to fine-scale local habitat characteristics Radio-tracking of 28 lactating females allowed location and census of 13 maternity roost sites Roosts were characterised at four detail scales (cavity, tree, stand, and landscape). All the roosts occurred m Quercus pyrenaica trees, within stands of the same species of very diverse structure. Ten of the roosts were former woodpecker holes, among which seven had their entrance modified by nuthatch Roosts were located inside the forest and close (< 620 m) to permanent water sources. Roost trees were characterised by a higher proportion of dead branches Other explored variables such as free height, orientation, foliar cover, and elevation did not explain distribution of roosts at any scale The species' breeding roost selection is described for the first time in a Mediterranean area

AB The density and identity of tree neighbourhood is a key factor to explain tree mortality in forests, especially during the stem exclusion phase.
   To understand this process, we built a logistic model for mortality in a spatially explicit context, including tree and neighbourhood predictors. Additionally, we used this model to build mortality risk frequency distributions. Finally, we tested this model against a random mortality model to predict the spatial pattern of the forest.
   Annual mortality rate was high for pedunculate oak (Quercus robur, 6.99%), moderate for birch (Betula celtiberica, 2.19%) and Pyrenean oak (Q. pyrenaica, 1.58%) and low for beech (Fagus sylvatica, 0.26%). Mortality risk models for pedunculate oak and birch included stem diameter, tree height, canopy position and neighbourhood. Mortalitywas affected by the specific nature of the neighbourhood showing a clear competitive hierarchy: beech > pedunculate oak > birch. Models based on random mortality and logistic regression model were able to predict the spatial pattern of survivors although logistic regression predictions were more accurate.
   Our study highlights how simple models such as the random mortality one may obscure much more complex spatial interactions.

DE Quercus pyrenaica; forest typology; multivariance statistics; national
   forestry inventory
AB The objective of this work is to propose a typology of Quercus pyrenaica in the district of Bierzo, northwest Spain, applying multivariance statistics to the plots of the third national forestry inventory. Six descriptor variables were selected and nine auxiliary calculated: the composition was represented with the cover value, and the ace structure with forest calibers in 4 classes. Following this method, the typology was elaborated on the base of 15 variables. The stages of the statistical analyses were: factor analyses and factor determination with maximum explained variance, clusters analyses and dendrogram confection to decide the number of types and discrimination analyses to find the variables with main discriminating power. The variables set was considered appropriate for the confection of typology because of the statistics values achieved. Thus, six types that described adequately the conditions of pastures (grazing grounds) were determined, among them: pure pole stand, degraded pole stand and mixed forests, which have been proposed as frequent for the Community of Castilla y Leon as well. Furthermore, this methodology allowed establishing a dichotomous key to assign new situations to the proposed types, through the use of clearly differentiable numerical parameters as well as an easily observable on field. Considering the similitude between South American Nothofiagus's forests and those of European fagaceous in which typologies have developed, they make of these a promising tool of forest management for Chile and Argentina.

AB We assessed the seasonal climatic response of 2 Pinus and 2 Quercus tree species in a littoral island in northwest Spain, analyzing earlywood, latewood, and total ring widths. We used bootstrapped response functions to identify the variables controlling growth, and we estimated the pure and shared effects of local climate components (temperature and water balance) and a large-scale atmospheric pattern (North Atlantic Oscillation, NAO) on tree growth using a variance partitioning approach. For all species, the response functions showed stronger climatic signals in latewood and total ring than in earlywood. The pure effects of temperature, water balance, and NAO on tree growth were significant. However, a null shared effect between local climate and NAO was evidenced due to the absence of a direct link between NAO in the previous autumn and the other significant climatic variables. Pinus pinaster was the species most sensitive to local climate, mainly to water availability during its active period as a consequence of higher water use efficiency. Quercus growth was negatively influenced by winter temperature, and growth of P. pinea and both Quercus species was inversely related to NAO in the previous autumn. The obtained results suggest that Q. robur and Q. pyrenaica have similar growth behaviour and climatic sensitivity. However, both P. pinea and P. pinaster showed contrasting growth dynamics and sensitivity in this Atlantic littoral island, despite their common Mediterranean origin.

AB A red wine made from the Syrah grape variety was matured in contact with 5 and 10 g/L of oak wood chips from Portuguese (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) or American (Quercus alba L.) oak species for 90 days, in order to evaluate the effects of the presence and concentration of these oak wood chip species on the antioxidant activity and the evolution of the proanthocyanidin fraction (monomeric, oligomeric and polymeric). The results showed an increase in the antioxidant activity in red wines aged in contact with the oak wood chip species during the first 52 days of storage followed by a slight decrease. The antioxidant activity values in the wine aged without oak wood chips remained nearly constant during the storage time. After 90 days, the presence of oak wood chips (especially a high concentration of the Portuguese oak species) had a positive effect on the antioxidant activity values and there was a high concentration of the monomeric proanthocyanidin fraction. For all the wines studied, the correlations between antioxidant activity and the monomeric fraction of proanthocyanidins were always high.

AB In this study, leaf morphology was assessed in a mixed oak stand (western France) using two geometric morphometric (landmark and outline) datasets and one dataset of 19 leaf measures. Adult oaks (817 oaks), comprising four white oak species (Quercus petraea, Q. robur, Q. pubescens and Q. pyrenaica), were sampled for DNA extraction and genetic analysis (nuclear microsatellites). Leaf morphology was assessed on 336 oaks, comprising pure species and hybrids as determined by genetic assignment. This comparative study of oak leaf morphology, based on the use of two free size geometric morphometric methods and a set of leaf measurements, combined with the genetic assignment of individuals to pure species or hybrids, provided information about the differences among species and the intermediate leaf morphology of their hybrids.

AB We examined the effects of simulated folivory by caterpillars on photosynthetic parameters and nitrogen (N) resorption efficiency in Quercus pyrenaica saplings. We analyzed the differences between intact leaves in control plants, punched leaves in damaged plants, and intact leaves in damaged plants. We then established two levels of simulated folivory: low (approximate to 13% of the leaf area of one main branch removed per plant) and high (approximate to 26% of the leaf area of one main branch removed per plant) treatments. No differences were found in net assimilation rate and conductance between either leaf type or treatment during the most favourable period for photosynthesis. However, the N content was lower in punched than in intact leaves, and as a result PNUE was higher in damaged leaves from treated trees. In leaf-litter samples, N mass was significantly higher in punched than in intact leaves in treated plants, and LMA was significantly higher in damaged than in intact leaves of both the treated and control plants. Consequently, N resorption efficiency was around 15% lower in damaged leaves as compared with intact leaves from treated and control plants. Mechanical injury to leaves not only triggered no compensatory photosynthetic response to compensate a lower carbon uptake due to leaf area loss, but also affected the resorption process that characterizes leaf senescence.

AB To explore the hypothesis that different ruminant species may differ in their ability to digest browse forages in the rumen, two in vitro experiments were conducted using batch cultures inoculated with rumen fluid (RF) obtained from either sheep or goats fed on the same diet (alfalfa hay). In vitro dry matter digestibility (IVD) and gas production kinetics were determined for 24 samples of leaves, flowers and fruits of five browse plant species: Erica australis; Cistus laurifolius; Quercus pyrenaica; Cytisus scoparius and Rosa canina, collected at upland sited in the province of Leon (NW Spain) from spring to autumn. There were no IVD differences between sheep and goat RF for any of the browse plant samples. The extent of degradation in the rumen was higher (P<0.05) with goat RF for leaves and flowers of R. canina and young leaves and fruits of Q. pyrenaica, with higher values (P<0.05) with sheep RF for leaves of C laurifolius harvested in September. Likewise, dry matter disappearance at 144 h was generally higher with goat RF and differences (P<0.05) were mainly detected for leaves and flowers of R. canina. However, although statistical differences between both sources of inoculum were not consistent among and within plant species, asymptotic gas production and gas production at 24 h were generally higher with sheep RE Gas production rate was faster (P<0.05) with sheep RF only for young leaves of E. australis and C scoparius and leaves of C laurifolius collected in June and September; however, with goat RF higher (P<0.05) values were detected for flowers of C laurifolius, fruits and mature leaves of Q. pyrenaica and flowers and young leaves of R. canina. Although some interspecies differences in the in vitro ruminal fermentative activity were detected in the present study, it can be concluded that when animals are fed the same diet, differences between sheep and goat rumen fluid used as source of inoculum can be considered of little nutritional significance.

AB In the present study, we determined the concentrations of Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn in soil and several trophic compartments at a total of 16 sampling stations. The trophic compartments studied were primary producers, represented by two species of terrestrial mosses (Pseudoescleropodium purum and Hypnum cupressiforme) and oak trees (Quercus robur or Q. pyrenaica); primary consumers, represented by the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) and the yellow necked mouse (A. flavicollis); secondary consumers, represented by the shrew (Sorex granarius); and finally, detritivores, represented by slugs (Arion ater). Thirteen of the sampling stations were located in mature oak woodlands (Quercus sp.); two of the sampling stations were located in the area surrounding a restored lignite mine dump, and the other in an ultrabasic area. The analytical determinations revealed a lack of significant correlations among trophic compartments, possibly caused by effective regulation of metals by organisms and/or spatial variation in availability of metals from soil or food. Furthermore, the only element that showed a clear pattern of biomagnification was Cu; as for the other elements, there was always some divergence from such a pattern. Finally, the patterns of bioaccumulation in contaminated and woodland sampling stations were very similar, although there was enrichment of the concentrations of Cu, Mn, and Zn in the mice viscera, which, except for Mn, were related to higher edaphic concentrations.

AB The evolution of almost 40 oak-related volatile compounds and the sensorial characteristics of red wines from four Spanish denominations of origin (DOs) (Bierzo, Toro, Ribera de Duero, and Rioja) during aging in barrels made of Rebollo oak wood, Quercus pyrenaica, were studied and compared to the same wines aged in American and French oak barrels. Each oak wood added unique and special characteristics to the wine, and in addition, each wine showed a different ability to extract the compounds, which result in these characteristics from the oak wood. In general, wines aged in Q. pyrenaica wood were characterized by high levels of eugenol, guaiacol, and other volatile phenols. In regards to compounds like cis-whiskylactone or maltol, the behavior of this wood is very similar to that of American oaks. When considering phenolic aldehydes and ketones, the levels of these compounds are intermediate between those of French and American woods and depend greatly on the type of wine. The type of oak, on the other hand, does not affect the chromatic characteristics of the wines. In sensory analysis, the biggest differences are found in the olfactory phase. Among the four DOs studied, wine aged in Q. pyrenaica presented the highest notes of wood, with more aromas of roasting, toasting, milky coffee, spices, or wine-wood interactions. The wines aged in barrels made of Q. pyrenaica wood were highly regarded, and preference was shown for them over those same wines when they had been aged in barrels of American or French oak.

AB Aim To reconstruct the historical biogeography of Pinus sylvestris in the Cantabrian Range (Iberian Peninsula) during the Holocene, and to consider the interactions between vegetation dynamics, climate change and the role of man in the present-day distribution of the species.
   Location The study site is a mire (1300 m a.s.l.) at Vega de Viejos, on a south-facing slope of the western Cantabrian Range, Spain. The region's present-day landscape is almost treeless, with the exception of some patches of Quercus pyrenaica and a few copses of Salix and Betula along stream banks.
   Methods Tree macrofossils from Vega de Viejos were studied by transmitted light and dark-field reflection microscopy; strobili were subjected to comparative morphological analyses. Two Pinus macrofossils were dated by conventional C-14 methods.
   Results The taxonomic accuracy achieved in the identification of the macrofossils provided new information regarding the Holocene history of Pinus sylvestris in this territory. Ninety-five cones of this species were identified; in fact, more than 80% of the 36 identified wood remains were of Pinus gr. sylvestris. Radiocarbon dating revealed that the forest to which the fossils belonged was present until at least 2170 +/- 50 yr BP - its disappearance was therefore relatively recent.
   Main conclusions Pinus sylvestris suffered long-term isolation, and after the Wurm glacial period tended to migrate towards the east. In western Iberia, a temperate climate and autogenic succession favoured broadleaved taxa at the expense of Pinus. Late Holocene human disturbances may have further accelerated the decline of P. sylvestris; in the Cantabrian Range, only a few stands on southern slopes have persisted until the present day. The history of the capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), a bird characteristic of pure or mixed Palaeartic coniferous forests, was almost certainly affected by the demise of these forests in this area. Cantabrian capercaillies are the only members of this species that live in purely deciduous forests, perhaps a recent adaptation to the regional extinction of pines. Today's P. sylvestris and capercaillie populations are now highly fragmented and their future, given the predictions of global climate change, is uncertain.

AB Interspecific differences in tree growth patterns with respect to biotic and abiotic factors are key for understanding forest structure and dynamics, and predicting potential changes under climate change.
   Repeated observations from the Spanish Forest Inventory (SFI) were used to parameterize maximum likelihood estimators of tree growth as a function of tree size, competition indices and climate for Pinus pinaster, P. sylvestris, Quercus ilex and Q. pyrenaica.
   Significant responses to both biotic and abiotic factors were found, with interspecific differences in species performance along competition, temperature and precipitation gradients. Q. ilex was the species most tolerant to competition while P. pinaster was the species most sensitive to climatic variation. Species relative positions shifted along gradients of these factors with rank reversals in species performance along size, competition and climatic gradients.
   The results based on average growth matched previous forestry classifications and experimental studies on relative growth rate (RGR).
   When examining growth along studied abiotic and biotic gradients, a mismatch was found between species performance ranks as predicted by our models and information derived from previous knowledge. Those discrepancies highlight the relevance of ontogeny and environmental heterogeneity in defining species performance along competition gradients.

AB Tree species can differ in their responses to resource availability during the critical phase of establishment, which could influence forest dynamics. In Mediterranean forests, most of the attention has focused on the effects of shade and summer drought on seedling survival, but little is known about the effect of autumn to spring rains on earlier stages of recruitment. A sowing experiment was set up along natural light and water gradients with three co-occurring oak species (Quercus suber L. (cork oak), Quercus canariensis Willd. (Algerian oak), and Quercus pyrenaica Willd. (Pyrenean oak)) that show limited natural regeneration in southern Spain. Recruitment stages were monitored for 1 year. Models of seed germination, seedling emergence, and seedling survival as well as of overall recruitment patterns were developed as functions of light, soil moisture, and soil compaction. The influence of intraspecific variation in seed mass and emergence time were also tested. Excess soil water levels during the winter reduced germination and emergence and lengthened time to emergence (in waterlogged open areas), which in turn decreased seedling survival during the dry season. Seedlings from larger seeds were more likely to germinate and emerge. The results suggest that temporal and spatial variability of soil water content, mediated by emergence time and seed size, play a crucial role in the regeneration dynamics of Mediterranean oak forests.

AB In the present study, carried out from 2004 to 2006, leaf and stem water potential and stem water content were measured in Quercus pyrenaica Willd. individuals in an experimental forested catchment located in Central Western Spain under Mediterranean subhumid conditions. These indicators of tree water status were compared with soil moisture contents measured in the same area from 0 to 1 m depth and from 0 to 2.5 m depth during the last year of the study. The objectives were to clarify the seasonal and year-to-year variations in tree water status, to examine applicability of stem water content as useful water stress indicator and to discuss how deep soil water and root uptake contribute to survival during the long dry summer. Seasonal variations in the tree variables measured revealed a typical pattern, with maximum values at the end of spring followed by a progressive decline during the summer drought in response to the decrease in soil water content (almost exhausted at 0-100 cm depth). The relatively high values and the non-significant variation in predawn leaf water potentials (except for 2005, which was exceptionally dry) indicate that no clear water stress situations occurred. This may be explained in terms of a progressive absorption of water from the deeper layers. The results also suggest that the stem water content is a more sensitive indicator of long-term water limitation than the other variables measured.

AB Light and water availability are two of the main factors that regulate growth and survival of Mediterranean woody plants. The objective of this study is to investigate the plastic response of seedlings of four Mediterranean Quercus species to these factors, as well as to determine what traits are more plastic to one or another factor. Our hypothesis was that physiological variables are more plastic than structural variables. We cultivated in controlled conditions seedlings of Quercus ilex ssp. ballota, Q. suber, Q. pyrenaica and Q. canariensis in three treatments of light (100, 27 and 3 % of incident light) and with abundant water. On late spring, watering was stopped for half of the seedlings, so there were two water treatments (irrigation versus no-irrigation) within each treatment of light. Several physiological traits were Studied: photosynthetic and respiration rate, light compensation and saturation points, stomatal conductance, water use and nitrogen use efficiency. We also evaluated different structural traits were studied Such as leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen and carbon concentrations, and a chlorophyll index. Changes in water availability induced low plastic responses of structural traits, whereas responses of physiological traits were relatively higher. On the other hand, there were not significant differences in the plastic response of structural or physiological traits to changes in light availability. In these Mediterranean oak species, the higher response to light could be linked to a shade tolerance strategy and the low response to water (i.e., canalization) could be related to drought tolerant strategy, thus indicating that tolerance to low-resources may be attained through different strategies.

AB Forest management is often carried out in different ways, without any appropriate environmental restrictions. Stands of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) in Galicia (NW Spain) have been harvested by alternating high forest and, mainly, coppice forest. However, some totally inappropriate silvicultural treatments have been used, such as thinning of the best trees and inadequate pruning. The objective of the present study was to analyse how environmental characteristics affect the management of oak forests in Galicia. For this, a botanical inventory was carried out in 39 selected stands of Q robur and a total of 42 parameters were measured, 4 of which were physiographical, 12 climatic, 19 edaphic and 7 silvicultural. In order to analyse the possible relationships among these variables, the silvicultural data were compared with the other data, by canonical correlation analysis. All parameters were correlated with the silvicultural regime, although the correlation was weak for the floristic data. It is therefore evident that the environmental conditions affect how forest stands should be managed, although this does not imply that more profitable use of the stands cannot be achieved than at present, and alternative silvicultural methods must be found to enable appropriate management and conservation of oak stands.

AB The fungal pathogen Pestalotiopsis funerea principally attacks conifer species, causing necrosis on infected tissues, and sometimes death of plants. The main objectives of this study were to determined optimal in vitro growth conditions for Spanish isolates of P. funerea and to evaluate the virulence of these isolates on Cupressus arizonica under field and laboratory conditions, with the goal of verifying possible correlations between these variables. Eight isolates of P. funerea derived from C. sempervirens, C. arizonica and Quercus pyrenaica were used in the assays. In the growth rate experiment, five culture media (PDA, MEA, WA, PCA and TAKAY medium) and six temperature (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C) were evaluated. In the pathogenicity tests, two different experiments were carried out; (i) laboratory inoculations used 30-mm-long twigs of C. arizonica; (ii) in field inoculations, twigs of C. arizonica were inoculated with mycelia through wounds. Four months after inoculation, lenght of the twigs affected by necrosis were measured. The results suggested that Spanish P. funerea isolates had optimum growth at 25 degrees C on TAKAY medium. The fungus caused substantial necroses on C. arizonica twigs after inoculation in both excised twigs and on adult C. arizonica trees. A positive relationship between inoculations carried out under laboratory and field conditions were found. No clear relationships were found between cultural characteristics and pathogenicity for P. funerea.

AB Since 1990s, time domain reflectometry (TDR) has been applied to estimate the stem water content of living trees. Here, new calibration equations relating the apparent dielectric constant (K-a) to the volumetric water content (theta) were developed for two Mediterranean oak species. Our calibration equations differ From those previously calculated for other species, Suggesting that stem water contents could be monitored more accurately using species-specific curves. The stem water content ill the trees of these species and the Surrounding soil were monitored with TDR to examine the feasibility of this technology for recording changes ill trunk water storage. The average stem water contents of the oaks reflect the soil water contents, and the temporal differences observed (17%) point to the importance of trunk water for coping with soil water deficit. Although it would be very useful to obtain a single function to estimate the stem water content of trees, it remains necessary to obtain the results in more species.

AB A nonlinear mixed-effects modelling approach was used to model the individual tree height-diameter relationship in pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.). A set of 24,627 pairs of height-diameter measurements were used to fit the model. These were taken at 950 Spanish National Forest Inventory plots embracing six different biogeoclimatic strata. Eleven biparametric nonlinear height-diameter equations were evaluated to find a local model, which only includes the dimensions of the tree as explanatory variables. After selecting the local model, a regional or generalized model was studied. The following stand variables were tested for inclusion in the model as fixed effects: stand density, quadratic mean diameter, arithmetic mean diameter, dominant diameter, arithmetic mean height, dominant height and basal area. Dominant height and basal area of the stand were found to produce the most satisfactory fits in the stand model. Interregional variability was studied by including strata effects as dummy categorical variables and was analysed using the non-linear extra sum of squares method and the Lakkis-Jones test. Height-diameter models were found to be similar for the six biogeoclimatic strata. Finally, a mixed nonlinear model technique was applied to fit the definitive model. By calibrating the model it is possible to predict random components of definitive model from height measurements previously taken from a subsample of trees. The different alternatives tested reveal that only two or three trees are necessary to calibrate the model. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil-tree water relationships were studied using time domain reflectometry (TDR) in two small forested basins in Spain. The stem water content of two Mediterranean Quercus species (Quercus pyrenaica and Quercus rotundifolia) was measured using previously constructed species- specific equations. To monitor soil moisture, a TDR station network was used in both cases. Sixteen Q. pyrenaica and six Q. rotundifolia individuals were selected to install two TDR probes in their trunks (at 20 and 120 cm above the ground) to monitor stem water content. Stem and soil water contents were measured fortnightly. The stem water content of both species showed a similar temporal trend for the period studied. A spring maximum (0-654 cm(3) cm(-3) for Q. pyrenaica and 0.568 cm(3) cm(-3) for Q. rotundifolia) was found to be associated with high transpiration and no soil moisture deficit, and a late-summer minimum (0.520 cm(3) cm(-3) for Q. pyrenaica and 0.426 cm(3) cm(-3) for Q. rotundifolia) was associated with the end of the dry season. This drop in stem water content occurs when the available water in the soil decreases. This seasonal difference presumably reflects water withdrawn from stem storage to support the transpirational demands of the tree. Since plant water stress results in reduced stem water content and since this drop can be measured by TDR, it may be concluded that this technology offers a suitable tool for detecting plant water stress.

AB In this work, new information is reported on water relations of the Mediterranean oak species Quercus pyrenaica based on environmental and physiological measurements carried out during the growing seasons of 2006 and 2007. The interest in this species has increased due to its use in reforestation programs and its impacts on the water resources due to the extensive spontaneous afforestation after the abandonment of forest (firewood, charcoal, livestock, etc.) and agricultural activities, in general in some areas in the Mediterranean region and in particular, in the studied area (Sistema Central range, Spain). The objectives were to evaluate the long-term water use of this stand and its limit and to analyse the specific traits to cope with summer drought, especially the use of stem water storage and deep soil water reserves. Tree water stress associated with depletion of soil water reserves was not observed since the oak trees appeared to avoid a marked water stress using water reserves from deeper soil layers as summer drought progresses. The contribution of mean daily stem water storage to transpiration was low (4%), although it could be greater under dryer conditions. Only at the end of summer of 2006, the transpiration and canopy conductance were reduced due to soil drought. Despite the absence of marked water stress an upper limit was found in transpiration (slightly higher than 3 mm day(-1)). The heavy use of soil water resources by this species (75% of available soil water in this study) should be considered when evaluating the impact of spontaneous afforestationand reforestation programs on water resources.

AB Quercus pyrenaica Willd. is distributed throughout the western Mediterranean and southwestern France (France, Portugal, Spain and Morocco). In the present work, these Pyrenean oak forest communities have been analysed, beginning with 228 phytosociological releves from 21 published tables. The data was numerically analysed by indirect gradient, using the detrended correspondence analysis (DCA). As a result, the relationship between all the used releves is shown and a synthetic table is made in order to clarify the syntaxonomical and phytogeographical affinities. Four phytocoenoses, formerly considered as associations, are proposed as synonymous and the existence of 14 associations is verified, 13 of these included in the order Quercetalia roboris (11 in the Mediterranean-submediterranean suballiance Quercenion pyrenaicae and 2 in the temperate suballiance Quercenion robori-pyrenaicae) plus 1 in the order Querco-Cedretalia atlanticae (alliance Violo munbyanae-Cedrion atlanticae, endemic to northern Africa).

AB Fluctuating asymmetry ( FA), random nondirectional deviations from perfect symmetry, has been proposed as a useful indicator of environmental stress. Nevertheless, FA acts as a nonspecific indicator of stress; thus, factorial designs are needed to disentangle which of the factors may induce FA. We used an experimental approach in which seedlings of Quercus pyrenaica were exposed to two levels of light, water, and simulated herbivory. To determine whether FA may operate as a stress indicator, leaf width and number of lobes were measured. Our predictions were ( 1) different levels of light, water, and herbivory can bring different levels of FA and ( 2) fluctuating asymmetry can act as an early stress indicator. As predicted, FA was higher in shade than in sun, both for leaf width and number of leaf lobes. By contrast, pruning affected FA only for number of lobes. FA was higher in pruned seedlings in the sun but lower in pruned seedlings in the shade. The two FA indices used(vertical bar L - R vertical bar and Var (L - R ) , where L and R represent the left and right leaf sides) gave similar results. Because leaf FA in Q. pyrenaica increased with low light radiation and simulated herbivory and both are important in the dynamics of Mediterranean communities, FA appears to be a possible tool as an indicator of environmental stress.

AB Climate change is expected to involve more-frequent and intense summer droughts in the Mediterranean region. This represents a threat for long-term persistence of woody species, such as European holly (Ilex aquifolium), that originated under humid climates during the Tertiary period. The capacity of this species to persist under increased water stress, both in gaps and in the understory of an oak-dominated woodland, was assessed by quantifying phenotypic plasticity in response to drought and shade. Physiological responses in plant-water relations and gas exchange were used as performance indicators under the different environments. Phenotypic plasticity of drought-stressed holly trees in response to changes in the light environment was low relative to the known response of co-occurring forest trees. Differences between morphological traits (e.g. specific leaf area and leaf: sapwood ratio in twigs) of sun- and shade-grown trees were small but significant while physiological traits were largely unresponsive to light availability. This supports the hypothesis that late-successional shade-tolerant species exhibit greater morphological than physiological plasticity. Sapling acclimation capacity through physiological mechanisms such as osmotic adjustment was insufficient to protect from summer drought. Holly mainly inhabits oceanic climates where extreme temperatures and droughts are unusual. Our results suggest that the species occupies a narrowing niche in continental Mediterranean habitats, and may lack the capacity to persist under more-severe future climate scenarios because of its low phenotypic plasticity in response to light and drought stresses.

AB The main objective of this study was to know the soil P availability in Quercus pyrenaica (deciduous oak) forests at the "Sierra de Gata" Mountains (Central Western Spain) and determine the factors controlling the availability of P in these soils. Twelve different oak stands along a rainfall gradient were selected, differentiating underlying geological materials: granites and schist-greywackes. Samples from selected soil horizons were taken and the available soil P was determined using an anion exchange membrane (P-AEM). P retention capacity (P-RC) was used as a rapid measure of soil P adsorption. P mineralization rate and acid phosphatase activity (APA) were determined in samples of the epipedons. Sites developed over schist-greywacke materials showed significantly lower contents of P-AEM than sites over granites. Soil P-RC was related positively to the contents of organically complexed Al + Fe and negatively to P-AEM contents, confirming that metal-organic complexes play an important role in the solubility and availability of soil P. The APA did not show any direct relationship neither with the net P mineralization rate nor with P-AEM, but did with the soil organic carbon (SOC) content. P mineralization did not only depend on the biochemical mineralization, but also on the biological mineralization of SOC by heterotrophic micro-organisms, which activity is favoured by the SOC content.

AB We investigated light acclimation in seedlings of the temperate oak Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. and the co-occurring sub-Mediterranean oak Quercus pyrenaica Willd. Seedlings were raised in a greenhouse for I year in either 70 (HL) or 5.3% (LL) of ambient irradiance of full sunlight, and, in the following year, subsets of the LL-grown seedlings were transferred to HL either before leaf flushing (LL-HLBF plants) or after full leaf expansion (LL-HLAF plants). Gas exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence, nitrogen fractions in photosynthetic components and leaf anatomy were examined in leaves of all seedlings 5 months after plants were moved from LL to HL. Differences between species in the acclimation of LL-grown plants to HL were minor. For LL-grown plants in HL, area-based photosynthetic capacity, maximum rate of carboxylation, maximum rate of electron transport and the effective photochemical quantum yield of photosystem 11 were comparable to those for plants grown solely in HL. A rapid change in nitrogen distribution among photosynthetic components was observed in LL-HLAF plants, which had the highest photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency. Increases in mesophyll thickness and dry mass per unit area governed leaf acclimation in LL-HLBF plants, which tended to have less nitrogen in photosynthetic components and a lower assimilation potential per unit of leaf mass or nitrogen than LL-HLAF plants. The data indicate that the phenological state of seedlings modified the acclimatory response of leaf attributes to increased irradiance. Morphological adaptation of leaves of LL-HLBF plants enhanced photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf area, but not per unit leaf dry mass, whereas substantial redistribution of nitrogen among photosynthetic components in leaves of LL-HLAF plants enhanced both mass- and area-based photosynthetic capacity.

AB Question: Will the predicted climate changes affect species distribution in the Iberian Peninsula?
   Location: Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal).
   Methods: We modelled current and future tree distributions as a function of climate, using a computational framework that made use of one machine learning technique, the random forest (RF) algorithm. This algorithm provided good predictions of the current distribution of each species, as shown by the area under the corresponding receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. Species turnover, richness and the change in distributions over time to 2080 under four Intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) scenarios were calculated using the species map outputs.
   Results and Conclusions: The results show a notable reduction in the potential distribution of the studied species under all the IPCC scenarios, particularly so for mountain conifer species such as Pinus sylvestris, P. uncinata and Abies alba. Temperate species, especially Fagus sylvatica and Quercus petraea, were also predicted to suffer a reduction in their range; also submediterranean species, especially Q. pyrenaica, were predicted to undergo notable decline. In contrast, typically Mediterranean species appeared to be generally more capable of migration, and are therefore likely to be less affected.

AB Information of tree-nurse shelterwood effects on survival of underplanted seedlings is particularly scant in Mediterranean forest ecosystems. To study light and water resources availability and survival associated to overstory density, two-year-old seedlings of Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. (sessile oak) and Quercus pyrenaica Willd. (pyrencan oak) were planted in the understory of an even-aged Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) plantation located in central Spain, which had been previously assigned to three density treatments: uncut, 33% thinned and 50% thinned of the original density, each replicated four times. Soil Moisture was measured with a TDR during the first growing season after planting. Light conditions were estimated by hemispherical photography. Survival was measured at the end of the first growing season in the field and at the beginning of the next two growing seasons. The reduction in density after thinning had a positive effect on light availability and on near-surface soil moisture. Pyrenean oak had higher survival rates than sessile oak, which showed similarly high mortality rates in all three overstory treatments. Thinning had a positive effect on the survival of Pyrenean oak, though irrespective of the intensity. Overall, these results point to the necessity to reduce canopy tree density in Mediterranean mountain pinewoods before carrying out enrichment plantations beneath.

AB In order to understand better the ecology of the temperate species Quercus petraea and the sub-Mediterranean species Quercus pyrenaica, two deciduous oaks, seedlings were raised in two contrasting light environments (SH, 5.3% full sunlight vs. HL, 70% full sunlight) for 2 years, and a subset of the SH seedlings were transferred to HL (SH-HL) in the summer of the second year. We predicted that Q. pyrenaica would behave more as a stress-tolerant species, with lower specific leaf area (SLA), allocation to leaf mass, and growth rate and less responsiveness to light in these metrics, than Q. petraea, presumed to be more competitive when resources, especially light and water, are abundant. Seedlings of Q. petraea had larger leaves with higher SLA, and exhibited a greater relative growth rate (RGR) in both SH and HL. They also displayed a higher proportion of biomass in stems (SMF), and a lower root to shoot ratio (R/S) in HL than those of Q. pyrenaica, which sprouted profusely, and had higher rates of photosynthesis (A(n)) and stomatal conductance (g(wv)), but lower whole-plant net assimilation rate (NAR). On exposure to a sudden increase in light, SH-HL seedlings of both species showed a short period of photoinhibition, but fully acclimated photosynthetic features within 46 days after transference; height, main stem diameter, RGR and NAR all increased at the end of the experiment compared to SH seedlings, with these increases more pronounced in Q. petraea. Observed differences in traits and responses to light confirmed a contrasting ecology at the seedling stage in Q. petraea and Q. pyrenaica in consonance with differences in their overall distribution. We discuss how the characteristics of Q. petraea may limit the availability of suitable regeneration niches to microsites of high-resource availability in marginal populations of Mediterranean climate, with potential negative consequences for its recruitment under predicted climatic changes.

AB Brenneria quercina has been reported as one of the causal agents of oak decline in Spain. To investigate the bacterial variability of this pathogen from different Spanish oak forests, a collection of 38 bacterial isolates from seven geographic locations and from different oak species was analysed by sequencing 16S rDNA and rep-PCR fingerprinting. All Spanish isolates of B. quercina were grouped by rep-PCR into a homogenous cluster that differed significantly from B. quercina reference strains from California. 16S rDNA analysis revealed that 34 out of 38 isolates were Brenneria. However, four isolates belonged to the genus Serratia, suggesting that this bacterium could cause cankers in oak trees. The information obtained by rep-PCR fingerprint analysis was used to develop PCR primers for the sensitive and specific detection of B. quercina from infected plant tissues. Pathogenicity tests performed with Brenneria and Serratia isolates showed that both were able to grow and cause cankers in oak trees.

AB The ecophysiological response to summer drought in seedlings of two co-occurring oak species (Quercus petraea and Quercus pyrenaica) outplanted below a dense Pinus sylvestris stand and a medium canopy gap was examined in two experiments carried out in central mountains of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain). Leaf water relations and gas exchange were studied in the first experiment. For both species, lower pre-dawn leaf water potential (psi(pd)) evidenced a higher degree of water stress in the understory seedlings, even though soil moisture was similar in both sites. Rates of photosynthesis (A(sat)) and stomatal conductance (g(sat)) at saturating light were higher in the gap seedlings in all measuring dates, but the earlier and more pronounced stress imposed in the understory precluded the comparison of tolerance responses between sites. Q. pyrenaica showed always higher A(sat) and g(sat) than Q. petraea, independently of psi(pd), which did not differ significantly between species. At the end of summer, values of A(sat)/g(sat) and leaf carbon isotopic composition reflected a less efficient water use in Q. pyrenaica. In the second experiment, growth and root development were examined in a different set of seedlings planted in the same sites. Q. petraea allocated less biomass to roots, and attained 20% higher total plant dry mass than Q. pyrenaica at the end of the second growing season in the field. For both species total plant dry mass and coarse plus fine root dry mass reached at this time were approximately three-fold higher in the gap than in the understory. Poor root development could explain the more limited access to water of seedlings outplanted in the understory. This study reveals that seedlings of Q. petraea and Q. pyrenaica planted under a dense, mature pine stand are more susceptible to summer drought and present a delay in growth with respect to a medium canopy gap.

AB In this study, a distance-independent mixed model was developed for predicting the diameter growth of individual trees in Mediterranean oak (Quercus pyrenctica Willd.) coppices located in northwest Spain. The data used to build the model came from 41 permanent plots belonging to the Spanish National Forest Inventory with the dependent variable being 10-year diameter increment over bark for trees larger than 7.5 cm at breast height. The basic field data required for predictions had been divided into four main groups: size of the tree, stand variables, competition indices and biogeoclimatic variables. The most significant independent variables were the individual-tree diameter, the basal area of trees larger than the subject tree, dominant height, site index and biogeoclimatic stratum. The model was defined as a mixed linear model with random plot effect, achieving an efficiency of 44.38%. The accuracy of the model was tested against the modelling data and against independent data from the same stands. Mixed model calibration of diameter increment was carried out with the independent data using a different sample of complementary observations of the dependent variable. The calibrated model was an improvement on the trivial model, which assumes constancy in diameter increment for a short projection period, especially the pattern of residuals with respect to predicted diameter and the independent variables.

AB The amount of standing genetic diversity found in oak coppice forests has been subjected to intense debate amongst forest ecologists and managers. In this study, the level of vegetative propagation and the genetic diversity found in a coppice forest of rebollo oak (Quercus pyrenaica) was examined. The current range of rebollo oak in the Iberian Peninsula reveals its adaptation to sub-Mediterranean mountain ecosystems. High sprouting capability, mainly by root suckers, has favoured traditional exploitation of rebollo oak in coppice forests. Using nine microsatellite loci, we have detected 14 clone assemblies compounded by 2-4 stems (7.9 +/- 1.3 ramets per genet, considering stand density) and covering an average surface of 11.4 m(2) per genet. The levels of genetic diversity and the amount of unique genotypes were high (D = 0.9972, G/N = 0.86) and similar to the clonality levels found in a nearby open oak woodland. Despite numerous clear-cutting rotations, known at least since 1750, and the heavy root sprouting observed after a thinning event, low clonal propagation (similar to 27%) was detected. This fact pointed towards the long-term persistence of several small clonal assemblies in this coppice. Our findings suggest that intense thinning practices are unadvisable in the conversion of Q. pyrenaica coppice into high forest due to the significant losses of genetic diversity when removing unique genotypes.

AB In the mid-twentieth century, in the centre of the province of Soria there was a wooded area made up of vigorous stands of Quercus pyrenaica exploited in the form of coppice forest. Given their good condition, some of these stands came under management projects that were aimed at ensuring the persistence of the tree cover and increasing their production levels and profitability.
   However, since the beginning of the 1960s, these sites underwent a profound transformation of their tree cover as a result of the works carried out by the State Forest Heritage. The persistent decline of the price of firewood and the consequent decrease in the income generated by coppicing practices, along with the increased demand for soft wood, were the main arguments used by the SFH to defend the conversion of these coppice hardwood stands into high forests of conifers.
   Moreover, this study aims to demonstrate that afforestation with conifers within the Spanish mainland could also respond to strictly productive criteria, in spite of what has sometimes been stated because of the usual slow growth rates associated.

AB Several low Molecular weight phenolic compounds - phenolic acids, phenolic aldehydes, coumarins, acetovanillone and ethyl vanillin - were quantified by HPLC in Portuguese wine brandies aged four years in Portuguese oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.), Allier oak (Quercus sessiliflora Salisb.) and chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) wooden barrels (250 L), in order to identify those of chemical markers of the wood botanical species. The results obtained demonstratedthat gallic acid, ellagic acid, ferulic acid, scopoletin, acetovanillone and ethyl vanillin play that role in the aged brandies. Gallic acid and acetovanillone present the highest contents in the brandies aged in chestnut, while ethyl vanillin exhibit the highest content in the brandies aged in oak woods. The differentiation of the brandies aged in oak woods is made by ellagic and ferulic acids. whose contents are higher in Portuguese oak, and by scopoletin that predominates in the brandies aged in Allier oak. Complementary, a practical and reproducible HPLC method was validated allowing a pod separation and quantification of acetovanillone and ethyl vanillin in wine aged brandies.

AB Interception, as the responsible process of the amount of precipitation never reaching the ground in vegetable communities, has been the object of several studies in various vegetation types, even though there are absences in the interception studies under some forested areas. This is the case of the Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.), one of the species that occupies more extension in the Iberian Peninsula, for which only a few studies have been carried out. In this sense, a study of the amount of throughfall in a small catchment covered by oak, has been conducted. To achieve this purpose, 64 throughfall collectors were placed in four different plots, which represent four different growth stages of the forest. In the analysis, the data monitored throughtout 25 months was used. This way, two complete seasonal periods could be sampled. The average percentage of throughfall in the catchment yields 14,9% of the total rainfall. This means that is evaporated to the atmosphere and is not part of the superficial hydrological cycle. In the period when the oaks have leaves, the average intercepted percentage was 18% and in the non-leaf period this percentage was the 11,9%.

AB The main edaphic properties of the natural forests of rebollo oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) in Galicia (NW Spain) were calculated. Forty soils distributed throughout the study area were sampled, and 10 edaphic parameters [four were related to chemical properties -pH, organic matter (OM), nitrogen (N), and carbon (C)/N ratio; four were related to soil fertility, phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg); and two to physical characteristics, fine earth and gravel, were estimated. Siliceous substrates were present in most of the stands, with schist and quartzite predominating, and the soils were basically Regosols. The values of soil chemical properties were similar to those reported as optimal values for oak forests [Quercus robur L. and Q. petraea (Matt.) Liebl.] in the study area (i.e., pH close to 5, OM approximately 4, C/N ratio approximately 18). The concentration of macronutrients, except phosphorus (9.4 ppm versus 21.8 ppm), can be considered high as compared with soils under Q. robur. With respect to physical characteristics, the dominant texture was sandy-loam and the gravel content was approximately 40%, with maximum values of more than 70%. The application of Principal Components Analysis to the parameters gave rise to four new variables which may explain nearly 83% of soil variability.

AB A bioclimatic analysis of the Spanish Quercus pyrenaica forests in the Iberian Peninsula was performed in this study. The purpose of this work was to find out the most suitable bioclimatic variables controlling the distribution patterns of Quercus pyrenaica forests in Spain. The study evaluated climatic data from 78 meteorological stations located in territories that could be potentially occupied by Quercus pyrenaica. The climatic information collected was processed with the BIOCLI computer program to diagnose their bioclimatic characteristics. Ten parameters and bioclimatic indices were afterwards analysed using an ordination statistical method (PCA). With this statistical approach, stations with similar bioclimatic features were grouped and subsequently these bioclimatic groups were associated to 14 different vegetation series of Quercus pyrenaica developing in Spain. The statistical analysis revealed the importance of the ombrothermic indices (mainly Summer Ombrothermic Indices) as well as the Compensated Thermicity Index as useful variables for the discrimination among the Spanish Quercus pyrenaica forests. Therefore, Summer Ombrothermic Indices are essential for the establishment of the boundaries between the temperate and mediterranean forests. The temperate forests require values of these indices higher than forests developing in mediterranean bioclimate. On the other hand, it turned out to be a thermic bioclimatic index of remarkable interest to distinguish either mesotemperate from supratemperate forests or mesomediterranean from supramediterranean ones. Finally, the combination of both type of indices allowed us to separate the Lusitan-Extremadurean, Betic and Gaditan-Alagavian forests that displayed summer ombrothermic indices values lower and generally Compensated Thermicity Index values higher than those of the Carpetan-Leonese forests.

ID VEGETATION
AB The geographical distribution of Quercus pyrenaica forests in the Iberian Peninsula is analysed from a climatic point of view. 438 phytosociological releves were collected and 28 climatic parameters were derived from their geographical features using the EST-CLIM model. The objectives of our work were to define the main climatic characteristics that explain the particular distribution pattern of Quercus pyrenaica forests in Spain and to obtain the climatic envelopes that best define these vegetation types. For this purpose, four floristic and their corresponding climatic matrices were analysed by means of Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Results show the importance of some climatic features that define the Mediterranean climate: summer dryness and winter precipitation, both of which serve to separate some types of forest. It is the case of Adenocarpo-Quercetum pyrenaicae and Berberido-Quercetum in southern Spain or Festuco-Quercetum and Luzulo-Quercetum, in the center of the Iberian Peninsula, which are separated in terms of summer dryness. Luzulo baeticae-Quercetum is well separated from the other two associations it was compared with (Arbuto-Querceturn and Sorbo-Quercetum) by winter precipitation. Exposure also plays an important role in some ranges such as the Sierra Madrona where a different type of forest appear in warmer or cooler exposures. Finally, other phytosociological adscriptions of releves to a type of association presented problems due to a very similar floristic composition, as is the case of Genisto falcatae-Quercetum and Holco-Quercetum. Regarding the differences between Eurosiberian forests and northern Mediterranean ones, separation resulted difficult since some of them (Melampyro-Quercetum) showed a not very clear separation from those Mediterranean forest they were compared (Genisto falcatae-Quercetum, Holco-Quercetum and Linario triornithophorae-Quercetum), in terms of the climatic variables analysed, however they showed a very different floristic composition.

AB Our objective was to examine the age structure of successionally young and mature old-growth stands dominated by Quercus pyrenaica, widely distributed on silicious substrates at 400-1800 in elevation in the Iberian Peninsula, France, and Morocco. Many hectares of young forest are recovering from intensive grazing and wood cutting as a result of land abandonment during the past several decades. Eight early-successional undisturbed stands, one intermediate-aged stand, and four old-growth stands were sampled. Age was determined by coring a subset of trees of various diameters and applying a regression formula to the dbh of 1316 trees among all 13 stands, so that every diameter could be expressed in years of age. Linear regression formulas accounted for 69-81 % of all diameter-age variation. For young stands, almost 2/3 of all trees were 30-39 yr of age, a dip in regeneration characterized the most recent 30 yr, and the oldest tree encountered was 90 yr old. For old stands, more than half the trees were 56-125 yr of age, a dip in regeneration characterized the most recent 75 yr, and the oldest tree encountered was 358 yr old. Thus, both young and mature stands showed depressed regeneration for at least the past three decades, a phenomenon shared by ecologically related oaks in California, where such age structures are interpreted as evidence of long-term population imbalance and instability.

AB The effects of urban sprawl and the associated road network on patterns of land use by diurnal raptors were assessed in a extent mosaic landscape of Sierra de Guadarrama subjected to exurban development (Madrid province; Central Spain), within the buffer area of a planned national park. During three consecutive years, the sightings of raptors per 0.25 km(2) were analyzed to identify their habitat preferences according to several vegetation types, urban cover and length of paved roads. Species richness increased with the amount of deciduous forests of Pyrenean oak Quercus pyrenaica and parklands of Narrow-leaved Ash Fraxinus angustifolia in lowland areas, while it decreased with cover of urban/suburban areas. Analyzing the three most abundant species separately, urban development had a negative influence on the Common Buzzard Buteo buteo and the Black Kite Milvus migrans, although positively affected the Booted Eagle Hieraaetus pennatus, probably through an increase in the availability of its potential prey within urban areas. This study did not find a negative influence of the road network, either considering total species richness or the three most abundant species separately. The current levels of urban development diminished the suitability of the study area for the raptor community overall (though particular species can be favoured), notably when residential sprawls are established over ash parklands traditionally devoted to cattle grazing.

AB The relationship between competition and tree growth was studied in four stands of Pinus sylvestris L. occurring in a continental Mediterranean mountain area (in the Guadarrama range, Spain), i.e., an uneven-aged stand, a stand with oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) understorey, a plantation, and a mature even-aged stand. Competition was measured by a simple size-ratio distance-independent index and was negatively associated with tree diameter. This negative association was stronger in the uneven-aged, plantation and mature even-aged stands than in the stand with oak understorey. Competition was also negatively associated with current diameter increment. This relationship was moderately strong in the mature even-aged stand and weak in the uneven-aged stand and the plantation. In the uneven-aged and the mature even-aged stands, a weakly significant relationship was found between diameter growth and tree size, whereas these parameters were not associated in the stand with oak understorey. The competition index provided a better prediction of growth rate than the alternative use of diameter. Both diameter and basal area growth were greater in the uneven-aged than in the even-aged stands.

AB Three hypotheses have been proposed to explain the functional relationship between seed mass and seedling performance: the reserve effect (larger seeds retain a larger proportion of reserves after germinating), the metabolic effect (seedlings from larger seeds have slower relative growth rates), and the seedling-size effect (larger seeds produce larger seedlings). We tested these hypotheses by growing four Mediterranean Quercus species under different light conditions (3, 27, and 100% of available radiation). We found evidence for two of the three hypotheses, but none of the four species complied with all three hypotheses at the same time. The reserve effect was not found in any species, the metabolic effect was found in three species (Q. ilex, Q. pyrenaica, and Q. suber), and the seedling-size effect in all species. Light availability significantly affected the relationships between seed size and seedling traits. For Q. ilex and Q. canariensis, a seedling-size effect was found under all three light conditions, but only under the lowest light (3%) for Q. suber and Q. pyrenaica. In all species, the correlation between seed mass and seedling mass increased with a decrease in light, suggesting that seedlings growing in low light depend more upon their seed reserves. A causal model integrates the three hypotheses, suggesting that larger seeds generally produced larger seedlings.

AB Natural vegetation in Europe appears nowadays deeply modified by human activities. In the Guadarrama Mountains (Central Spain), ancient reforestations with Scots pines, Pinus sylvestris, replaced original deciduous pyrenean oak, Quercus pyrenaica, forests (since the Roman period). However, the effect of reforestations on fauna remains little known, especially in reptiles. We described patterns of microhabitat selection in several species of Lacertid lizards, and analyzed whether the modification of the original vegetation affected distribution and population densities of lizards. The species of lacertid lizards found in oak forests (Psammodromus algirus, Lacerta lepida and Podarcis hispanica) were different to those of in pine plantations (Podarcis muralis and Podarcis hispanica). Lizards did not use habitat at random and this could explain differences in species found in both forests, which differed in some microhabitat structure characteristics. Most lizards selected microhabitats with rocky outcrops, with low cover of trees, and close to refuges. These microhabitat preferences also explained abundance of lizards in transects. From the perspective of conservation and management of lizards, pine plantations seem not to contribute too much to the diversity of lizard species because species typical from oak forests were lost. This study has implications for pine reforestation management, because allowing the recolonization by understory oaks, and leaving some open areas, without trees but with dense shrubs and rocks inside reforestations would contributed to maintain lizard populations.

AB The biotopes occupied by pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) and rebollo oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) in Galicia were characterized using different parameters, enabling a comparative analysis of its habitats. Thirty-nine plots of pedunculate oak and 40 of rebollo oak were inventoried and 25 ecological parameters (physiographic, climatic and edaphic) were measured to describe the biotopes, along with 14 stand parameters to characterize the structure and the silviculture of these forests; some of them were used in previous works about the autecology of both species. Quercus robur was found to occupy a wider range of ecological habitats and their distribution is oceanic; Q. pyrenaica presents a more Mediterranean phytoclimatic position. The results indicated that the distribution of oak forests in Galicia is more closely related to physiographic and climatic features than to edaphic, because the nature of the substrates that they occupy is similar. Analysis of fragility/aggressiveness between both species and chestnut shows that the aggressiveness of both oaks, mainly pedunculate, was much higher, except at high altitudes, and in areas with a high mean temperature, where rebollo is more aggressiveness. Comparison of the two Quercus shows for most of the parameters that Q. robur is the more aggressive species.

AB Three techniques for obtaining soil water solutions (gravitational and matrical waters extracted using both in situ tension lysimeters and in vitro pressure chambers) and their later chemical analysis were performed in order to know the evolution of the soil-solution composition when water moves down through the soil, from the Ah soil horizon to the BwC- or C-horizons of forest soils located in western Spain. Additionally, ion concentrations and water volumes of input waters to soil (canopy washout) and exported waters (drainage solutions from C-horizons) were determined to establish the net balance of solutes in order to determine the rates of leaching or retention of ions. A generalized process of sorption or retention of most components (even Cl-) was observed, from the soil surface to the C-horizon, in both gravitational and matrical waters, with H4SiO4, Mn2+, Na+, and SO42- being the net exported components from the soil through the groundwater. These results enhance the role of the recycling effect in these forest soils. The net percentages of elements retained in these forest soils, considering the inputs and the outputs balance, were 68% K+, 85% Ca2+, 58% Mg2+, 7% Al3+, 5% Fe3+, 34% Zn2+, 57% Cl-, and 20% NO3-, and about 75% of dissolved organic carbon was mineralized.

AB Oak forests in the Northwest Iberian Peninsula represent climax communities with a high floristic diversity of vascular plants. This study presents data from 189 botanical samples randomly collected in stands of deciduous and semi-deciduous oak as Quercus robur (98), Q. petraea (50) and Q. pyrenaica (41). Within these stands, 187 species or subspecies were identified, in addition to 20 genera and 68 families, all of them present in forests of Quercus robur. A total of 126 species occur in more than five releves. The largest number of species corresponds to Poaceae (22), Fabaceae (19) and Rosaceae (14). The biological spectrum is dominated by hemicryptophytes, with mainly Atlantic and Sub-Atlantic floristic elements. The distribution of the stands has been studied by using Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis, obtaining like pseudo-species, with shrubby and arborea form, the following ones: Fagus sylvatica, Castanea sativa, Sorbus aucuparia, Corylus avellana, Crataegus monogyna, Pyrus cordata, Erica arborea, Frangula alnus and Cytisus scoparius.

AB The type of vegetation cover determines the physicochemical and biological properties of the soil over which they are developing. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of different vegetation covers oil the forms of soil phosphorus, in order to know which of these forms can be used as a soil quality indicator. The experimental area was located on the acidic plateau at the North of Palencia (North Spain), where an area was selected vegetation covers very close to each other: pine (Pinus sylvestris), oak (Quercus pyrenaica), and three different shrub species (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, Erica australis and Halimium alyssoides). The All horizon was sampled and pH, total organic C (C-org), total N (N), cationic exchange capacity (CEC), sum of bases (S) and P forms by a sequential fractionation were analysed. Results showed that oak and A. uva-ursi improve the considered soil parameters (pH, C-org/N ratio, CEC, and S) and provide soils of better quality. Inorganic soil P forms were influenced in greater extent by the vegetation cover than were P organic forms. Labile inorganic P forms could be used as indicators of soil quality. The organic P forms were less sensitive than inorganic ones to the indicated improvements. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The substrates are principally siliceous, with schists and quartzites predominating; the dominant textural composition is sandy-loam with a scarce presence of clayey-loam and sandy textures, and the soils are basically Umbric Regosol-type. The values of the parameters that reflect the chemical properties of the soil, i.e., the pH, organic matter, nitrogen, and C/N ratio, are similar to those reported as optimal for Quercus spp. forests in the study area. However, the concentrations of macronutrients, except for phosphorous, were higher than in soils under Quercus robur L. with notably high concentrations of the micronutrient iron.

AB Anthropogenic changes in forest structure threats the persistence of numerous organisms. In Spain, Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) forests are mainly subjected to three sylvopastoral management systems which determine variations in the forest structure: (i) "young forests" subjected to frequent disturbance by fires and clear-cuttings; (ii) "Pyrenean oak dehesas", subjected to a traditional sylvopastoral system exclusive to Spain which favours the development of both old oaks and pasture; (iii) largely undisturbed "mature forests". We examined the effects of these sylvopastoral management systems on habitat use and reproduction of the middle spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos medius), a forest specialist bird, at the south-western edge of its distribution range. Habitat use was examined at multiple spatial scales. Within the territories, woodpeckers preferred large diameter oaks for foraging and decay oaks with holes for nesting. Within the forest tracts, no significant relationships between territory density and habitat structure in the forest tracts were found. At the landscape scale, dehesas and mature forests, both with high densities of important foraging and nesting trees, were occupied by woodpeckers. Young forests, with low densities of those trees, were avoided. No significant differences in territory density or reproductive success were found between dehesas and mature forests. The maintenance of viable woodpecker populations requires conservation actions at several spatial scales. Within the forest tracts, suitable densities of important foraging and nesting trees must be maintained. At the landscape scale, management decisions must consider the maintenance of traditional sylvopastoral systems in dehesas and mature forests. At the regional scale, taking into account a habitat cover in the landscape of the 7% for the Cantabrian Mountains, we estimated an area of 285,000 ha to be included in the conservation planning unit for the middle spotted woodpecker.

AB Radial growth patterns of Quercus robur L., Quercus pyrenaica Willd., Pinus pinaster Ait., Pinus pinea L. y Laurus nobilis L., the dominant tree species in the Cortegada island, Parque Nacional de la Islas Atlanticas de Galicia, were studied. The main objective was to determine the repercussion that land-use changes that occurred during the last century in the island, had on tree growth. The influence of the climatic variables mean monthly temperature and monthly precipitation on high frequency radial growth variation was also studied. The results show that the chronologies derived from all studied species reflect the succession of events that happened in the island in the XX century, with a gradual tree establishment along the first half of the century, a progressive canopy Closure and the recent apparition of canopy gaps due to disturbances. The correlations between the climatic parameters and the year-to-year growth variations also reveal a higher tolerance of Q. pyrenaica and P pinea to water shortage in spring and summer.

AB The species composition of the plant community and the soil characteristics in Quercus pyrenaica ecosystems according to the degree of disturbance and the type of human intervention (burning, cutting, livestock grazing) were compared. Four types of oak communities were selected, each with five replicates: oak shrublands (SL), dehesas (DE) or open woodlands used for grazing, and two types of mature oak forest, one with abundant shrub biomass in the understory (FS) and the other with little shrub biomass in the understory (FO). A total of 175 species were found in the 20 sites studied, 52 appeared in a single site. The dehesas were the most different regarding species composition, with 30 species only found there. This was verified by a qualitative similarity analysis, in which the five dehesas formed a group clearly distinguishable from the other sites; the oak shrublands also formed a group, but it was not possible to distinguish between the mature oak forests with and without a shrubby understory. However, the soil characteristics were similar across all sites and differences could only be detected in organic matter and nitrogen content, which were significantly higher in the mature forests without a shrubby understory. When the plant community and soil characteristics were analysed as a whole using a canonical correspondence analysis, the separation of the dehesas was observed on the first axis, due to its greater richness and abundance in herb species, especially annuals. The other sites were ordered on the second axis, with greater differences between the oak shrublands, associated with higher shrub species cover, and the mature open forests, associated with forest herb species and a soil with a higher nitrogen, organic matter and cation exchange content. The mature forests with abundant shrub biomass were in an intermediate position. Therefore, although the differences in soil were not important and many species were common to all types of Q. pyrenaica communities, the type of human intervention did determine changes, as shown by the results of the multifactorial analyses. In addition, given that all the community types presented some species which were not found in the other types, greater biodiversity would be attained by preserving all of them.

AB Oaks are model species for the study of natural introgressive hybridization. High interfertility among oak taxa might result in collective evolution, through transpecific spread of advantageous alleles, challenging the standard concept of species. Nine highly polymorphic microsatellite (nuSSR) loci were analysed in three mixed oak populations of Quercus pyrenaica and Quercus petraea (Montejo, Somosierra and Robregordo) with different density and hybridization rates. Both leaf morphology and molecular markers were used to assess individual admixture rates. Insights about the relative effect of density and hybridization rates on fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS) were obtained from autocorrelograms and Sp statistics. Differences in SGS among populations were higher than between species. These differences cannot be attributed solely to census densities but also relate to other factors, such as the spatial configuration of the population. Hybridization was an important factor shaping within-population spatial genetic structure, and an interspecific component of SGS was found in Somosierra. Indirect estimates of historical gene flow in Montejo were compared with actual values of gene dispersal assessed by parentage analysis in a former study. Similar values were found for current and historical gene flow in both species, which might reflect demographical stability.

AB Soil-surface CO2 efflux and its spatial and temporal variation were investigated in a southern Mediterranean, mixed pine-oak forest ecosystem on the northern slopes of the Sierra de Guadarrama in Spain from February 2006 to July 2006. Measurements of soil CO2 efflux, soil temperatures, and moisture were conducted in nine 1963-m(2) sampling plots distributed in a gradient around the ecotone between Pinus sylvestris L. and Quercus pyrenaica Lam. forest stands. Total soil organic matter, Walkey-Black C, particulate organic matter, organic matter fraction below 53 mu m, total soil nitrogen content, total soil organic carbon content, and pH were also measured under three representative mature oak, pine, and mixed pine-oak forest stands.
   Soil respiration showed a typical seasonal pattern with minimums in winter and summer, and maximums in spring, more pronounced in oak and oak-pine stands. Soil respiration values were highest in pine stands during winter and in oak stands during spring and summer. Soil respiration was highly correlated with soil temperatures in oak and pine-oak stands when soil moisture was above a drought threshold of 15%. Below this threshold value, soil moisture was a good predictor of soil respiration in pine stands. Greater soil organic matter, particulate organic matter, Walkey-Black C, total organic C, and total N content in pine compared to oak sites potentially contributed to the greater total soil CO2 efflux in these stands during the winter. Furthermore, opposing trends in the organic matter fraction below 53 mu m and soil respiration between plots suggest that in oak stands, the C forms are less affected by possible changes in use. The effects of soil properties on soil respiration were masked by differences in soil temperature and moisture during the rest of the year. Understanding the spatial and temporal variation even within small geographic areas is essential to assess C budgets at ecosystem level accurately. Thus, this study bears important implications for the study of large-scale ecosystem dynamics, particularly in response to climatic change.

AB Question: What are the edge effect responses of epiphytic lichen communities in Mediterranean Quercus pyrenaica forest?
   Location: Central Spain.
   Methods: We established ten transects perpendicular to a road dissecting a well conserved remnant of Q. pyrenaica forest into two sections. Transects extended from the forest/road edge to 100 m into the forest. Data were collected from seven plots in each transect at different distances from the edge. Variables were grouped into stand scale variables (distance to edge, number of trees per plot, mean diameter per plot, irradiance) and tree scale variables (diameter and height of sampled trees, aspect of the sampled square and relative height of the square). We used General Mixed Linear Models and constrained ordination techniques to test the hypothesis that the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of light and water controls the occurrence of lichens and bryophytes along the edge-interior gradient in the Q. pyrenaica forest.
   Results: Microclimatic parameters vary in a non-linear way; edge and interior stands showed the most divergent and extreme values. Although the micro-environment within Mediterranean forests is heterogeneous, interior conditions are apparently suitable for the performance of some specific forest epiphytes. Consequently, species richness does not show significant differences along the gradient. Total epiphytic cover increases towards the forest interior, but distance to the edge together with other predictors at the tree scale (aspect and height of the square) are the most relevant predictors for the composition and structure of these communities.
   Conclusions: Composition and structure of epiphytic communities in a Mediterranean semi-deciduous forest are affected by the edge between the forest and the road constructed. Since some extremely rare lichens only occur at interior stands, the conservation of these threatened elements requires urgent conservation measures because well preserved and unmanaged forests in the Mediterranean region are very rare.

AB The chemical composition of heartwood from the Spanish oaks Quercus petraea and Q. pyreuaica includes a wide range of volatile compound families (volatile phenols, phenolic aldehydes, furanic compounds, lactones, phenyl ketones, and others), which are potentially extracted into wine during aging. Changes in volatiles during the natural seasoning process followed in barrel cooperage were studied. Volatile compounds varied during seasoning, with some increasing in concentration while others decreased or did not show significant variations. The evolution of the wood was most significant during the first two years of seasoning, followed by stabilization during the third year, with variations depending on species, origin, and seasoning environmental conditions.

AB The ellagitannins and ellagic acid from extracts of Portuguese oak wood chips (Quercus pyrenaica) used in cooperage from different origins (Geres and Guarda forests) were analysed by HPLC. The results were compared with the ellagitannin content of wood chips obtained from American (Q. alba) and French (Q. petraea) oak. The influence of heat treatment and the coarseness of the grain on ellagitannins and ellagic acid were also studied. Five ellagitannins (vescalagin, castalagin, roburin D, roburin E and grandinin) and ellagic acid were quantified. Vescalagin and castalagin were the most abundant individual ellagitannins in all of the oak wood chips studied. Portuguese oak wood had the highest content of ellagitannins and ellagic acid, followed by the French and American oaks. The geographical origin of Portuguese oak and the coarseness of the grain of French oak affected the content of ellagitannins and ellagic acid. In general, the ellagitannin content decreased with the toasting process, while the ellagic acid content increased. The toasting process had the highest impact on ellagitannin composition in comparison to the other variables studied.

DE beef cattle; in vitro gas production; Pyrenean oak; tannin
AB Two experiments were conducted to study the effect of the consumption of different amounts of immature Pyrenean oak leaves (OL) by beef cattle on in vitro ruminal fermentation and potential adaptation of rumen microorganisms. A total of twelve ruminally cannulated young Brown Swiss bulls were divided in experimental groups that received different amounts of OL via the ruminal cannula (on average 0, 2.5, 5.2 and almost 10 kg fresh matter per animal and day). The gas production technique was used to study in vitro fermentation of two substrates (grass hay and OL) incubated with rumen inocula derived from each bull. Results suggest not only a dose-dependent negative effect of tannins consumption on ruminal fermentation of common feeds (e.g., grass hay), but also an adaptation of rumen microbial populations from animals receiving moderate amounts of OL. The high level of tannins in the rumen of bulls that received the highest amount of OL would have exceeded the ability of microorganisms to tolerate or detoxify them.

AB The puparial stage is described for each of four saproxylic hoverflies ( Diptera, Syrphidae): Ferdinandea fumipennis Kassebeer, 1999, Mallota dusmeti Andreu, 1926, Myolepta difformis Strobl, 1909, and Myolepta obscura Becher, 1882. Early stages were collected at Cabaneros National Park in Ciudad Real province, central Spain. Mallota dusmeti, M. difformis, and M. obscura were found in water-filled holes of live Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl. trees and the larva of F. fumipennis was found in a sap run on a live Quercus pyrenaica Wild. tree. Larvae were identified by rearing them to the adult stage. Puparia of these species possessed generic-level characters found in congenerics. Apparent species-level characters separating them from early stages of congenerics are proposed. The records reported here are the first for the Iberian Peninsula of M. obscura. Mallota dusmeti, M. difformis, and Myolepta obscura are extremely rare in Europe with M. dusmeti classed as "vulnerable'' in the Spanish Invertebrate Red Data Book.

AB In 2000, one-year-old seedlings of pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea [Matt.] Liebl) were planted in a thinned and an unthinned plot in a pinewood (Pinus sylvestris), and in a nearby clearing. In summer 2002 and 2003, water relations and gas exchange parameters were measured to address the impact of drought on the seedlings. Chlorophyll a fluorescence was also measured to explore leaf photochemistry and a possible non-stomatal limitation to photosynthesis (A). Reduction in stomatal conductance (g) in response to the decrease of predawn water potential (Psi(pd)) resulted the main cause affecting net carbon uptake. Water potential at midday (Psi(md)) was similar in both species but Quercus petraea was more sensitive to soil water deployment occurred along summer, showing slightly lower Psi(pd) because worse recover of water potential during night. Rate of photosynthesis was higher in Q.pyrenaica probably in relation to its greater leaf mass per area (LMA) and nitrogen content per leaf area (N-a). Mortality was highest in the clearing and lowest in the thinned pinewood. Throughout the summer, soil moisture was higher in the thinned area, possibly because of the reduction in tree transpiring surface and interception of rainfall. Accordingly, Psi(pd) of both species was higher in the thinned site.

   STATUS
AB Photosynthetic acclimation of two co-occurring deciduous oaks (Quercus petraea and Quercus pyrenaica) to a natural light gradient was studied during one growing season. In the spring of 2003, 90 seedlings per species were planted along a transect resulting from a dense Pinus sylvestris stand, an adjacent thinned area and a 10-m-wide firebreak (16.5-60.9% Global Site Factor (GSF)). In two dates of the following summer, we measured leaf gas exchange, carboxylation efficiency (CE), chlorophyll and nitrogen content, light-response curves of chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters, and leaf mass per area (LMA). Summer was mild, as evidenced by leaf predawn water potential (Psi(pd)), which reduced the interactive effect of water stress on the response of seedlings to light. Q. pyrenaica had higher LMA, CE, stomatal conductance (g(s) (max)) and photosynthesis per unit area (A(max)(a)) than Q. petraea at all growth irradiances. A(max)(a), LMA, g(s) (max) and electron transport rate (ETR) all increased with light availability (GSF) in a similar fashion in both species. Light had also a clear effect on the organization of Photosystem II (PS II), as deduced by chlorophyll a fluorescence curves. Chlorophyll concentration (Chl(m)) decreased with increasing light availability in Q. pyrenaica but it did not in Q. petraea. Seedlings of Q. petraea acclimated to higher irradiances showed a greater non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) than those of Q. pyrenaica. This suggests a higher susceptibility to high light in Q. petraea, which would be consistent with a better adaptation to shade, inferred from the lower LMA or the lower rate of photosynthesis.

AB We studied the effects of traditional forest management practices (i.e. forest exploitation activities such as burning, cutting and livestock grazing) on carabid beetle (Coleoptera, Carabidae) assemblages in Pyrenean oak forests of NW Spain. A total of 11 370 carabid individuals representing 61 species were collected by pitfall trapping from May to October 2004 in four types of traditionally managed oak ecosystems: "dehesa", "mature open", "mature closed" and "young". These four management types experienced a variety of anthropogenic activities, resulting in differences in the structure and composition of the tree and understorey vegetation layers. We showed that the four management types were quite similar at the carabid assemblage level, mainly supporting open habitat and generalist species. The "dehesa" system was most distinct with a higher species richness (not significantly) and with several unique species, probably travelling from the adjacent grassland. However, many species responded significantly to the type of management, depending on the habitat associations of the species. We also found strong responses of some of the species to one type of management, either positive (exclusively collected from one management type) or negatively (completely absent). Shrub cover and soil organic matter content were the main environmental variables determining the carabid assemblage structure. At the regional scale, the four management types accounted for a high carabid beetle diversity. This diversity appears to be threatened by landscape homogenization, since traditional management practices are disappearing due to recent land-use changes in the area. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB A dominant height growth model and a site index model were developed for rebollo oak (Quercus pyienaica Willd.) in northwest Spain. Data from 147 stem analysis in 90 permanent plots, where rebollo oak was the main species, were used for modelling. The plots were selected from the National Forest Inventory at random in proportion to four biogeoclimatic stratums. Different traditional and generalized algebraic difference equations were tested. The evaluation criteria included qualitative and quantitative examinations and a testing with independent data from another region. The generalized algebraic difference equation of Cieszewski based on Bailey equation showed the best results for the four stratums. An analysis of the height growth patterns among ecological stratums was made in order to study the necessity of different site index curves. Results indicated the validity Of a common height growth model for the four stratums. In spite of the irregular height growth pattern observed in rebollo oak, probably due to past management, the model obtained allows us to classify and compare correctly rebollo oak stands growing at different sites.

AB Inter-specific differences in seedling survival responses along a sun-shade gradient and the influence of low-water availability were examined for four Iberian tree species (Quercus robur L., Quercus pyrenaica Willd., Pinus sylvestris L. and Pinus pinaster Ait.) typical of the cool temperate-Mediterranean transition zone. Seedlings were grown under controlled conditions in a factorial experiment with four levels of irradiance (1%, 6%, 20% and 100% of full sunlight) and two levels of water availability. Five censuses (from late spring to autumn) leading to four regular intervals (T-0 -> T-I; T-I -> T-II; T-II -> T-III; T-III -> T-IV) were established. Statistical models of seedling survival as a function of irradiance were calibrated throughout the whole experiment (T-0 -> T-IV) and also for each time interval and water availability level. Seedling survival responses among different species diverged both in the type of functional response to irradiance and in their response to water stress. Ranking of species according to shade tolerance (Q. pyrenaica > Q. robur > P. sylvestris > P. pinaster) contrasted with tolerance of high irradiance and conformed to a hypothetical sun-shade trade-off for survival (i.e. species having higher survival in low irradiance-oaks-had poorer survival at high irradiance and vice-versa). Low-water availability also differentially affected each species, with pines being more drought tolerant than oaks. At an intra-specific level, low-water availability decreased survival of Q. pyrenaica under both high and low irradiance. For Q robur, however, low-water availability exerted a relatively stronger effect under low irradiance. Consequences of the interplay between irradiance and water availability for explaining segregation and coexistence of forest tree species at the ecotone between cool temperate and Mediterranean forests are discussed.

AB We investigated the differential roles of physiological and morphological features on seedling survivorship along an experimental irradiance gradient in four dominant species of cool temperate-Mediterranean forests (Quercus robur L., Quercus pyrenaica Willd., Pinus sylvestris L. and Pinus pinaster Ait.). The lowest photochemical efficiency (F-v/F-m, in dark-adapted leaves) was reached in deep shade (1 % of full sunlight) in all species except Q. robur, which had the lowest photochemical efficiency in both deep shade and 100% of full sunlight. Species differed significantly in their survival in 1% of full sunlight but exhibited similar survivorship in 6, 20 and 100% of full sunlight. Shade-tolerant oaks had lower leaf area ratios, shoot to root ratios, foliage allocation ratios and higher rates of allocation to structural biomass (stem plus thick roots) than shade-intolerant pines. Overall phenotypic plasticity for each species, estimated as the difference between the minimum and the maximum mean values of the ecophysiological variables studied at the various irradiances divided by the maximum mean value of those variables, was inversely correlated with shade tolerance. Observed morphology, allocation and plasticity conformed to a conservative resource-use strategy, although observed differences in specific leaf area, which was higher in shade-tolerant species, supported a carbon gain maximization strategy. Lack of a congruent suite of traits underlying shade tolerance in the studied species provides evidence of adaptation to multiple selective forces. Although the study was based on only four species, the importance of ecophysiological variables as determinants of interspecific differences in survival in limiting light was demonstrated.

AB The need for new sources of quality wood supply for cooperage has led to looking into the possibility of utilizing Quercus pyrenaica Wild. oak, a species native to the Iberian peninsula, as an alternative to other European (Quercus robur and Qurecus petraea) and American (Quercus alba) oaks. The low molecular weight phenolic composition, ellagitannins, and volatile compounds (including a wide range of compound families such as volatile phenols, furanic compounds, lactones, phenyl ketones, other lignin-derived compounds, and volatile compounds related to off-flavors) of green heartwood from Spanish forest regions were studied by HPLC and GC, in order to know its enological characteristics. The chemical composition of Q. pyrenaica is similar to that of other species commonly used in cooperage to make barrels, showing only quantitative differences that were more significant with respect to American than to French species. The four provenance regions studied showed similar chemical composition, with high variability among individuals, often higher than the variability among regions of provenance, but in line with that described in other European and American oak woods. Therefore, this species must be considered to be suitable for aging wine.

AB 39 natural forests of "carballo" (Quercus robur) and 40 of "rebollo" (Q. pyrenaica) were inventoried in Galicia, analyzing their types of soils, their chemical properties and content in macronutrients, using 16 edaphic parameters. The substrates are predominantly siliceous, with predominance of granites, schists and quartzites, being the dominant texture in forests of carballo the sandy one, with cambisol soils and slimesandy in rebollo with regosols. The parameters reflecting chemical properties have similar values in both cases, nevertheless, content in macronutrients, except phosphorus, is higher in forests of Q. pyrenaica.

AB Crown architecture and light-harvesting efficiency (Ea) were compared in seedlings of eight Quercus species from contrasting environments. Several morphological variables were measured after one year of growth under the same environmental conditions. Ea was estimated with the 3-D model Y-plant. The species were classified in four groups according to their Ea: Q. rubra-Q. alba > Q. faginea-Q. pyrenaica > Q. robur-Q. ilex-Q. coccifera > Q. suber. Principal component analysis revealed that the constraining morphological variables for maximizing Ea were the total number of leaves and the variability of internode length. Two contrasting growth models were associated with distinct environments and significantly different Ea: evergreen, Mediterranean species (e.g. Q. suber), which showed a multilayered crown of many small leaves rendering low Ea, versus deciduous, non-Mediterranean temperate species (e.g. Q. rubra), which showed the opposite characteristics.

AB The ecophysiological mechanisms underlying plant-plant interactions and forest regeneration processes in Mediterranean ecosystems are poorly understood, and the experimental evidence for the role of light availability in these processes is particularly scant. We analyzed the effects of high and low irradiances on 31 ecological, morphological and physiological variables in saplings of four late-successional Mediterranean trees, two deciduous (Acer opalus subsp. granatense (Boiss.) Font Quer & Rothm. and Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) and two evergreen (Pinus nigra Arnold subsp. salzmannii (Dunal) Franco and Quercus ilex L.), which coexist in mature montane forests. Species differed in both their capacity to withstand high radiation and in their shade tolerance. The two deciduous species were the least tolerant to high radiation, exhibiting both dynamic and chronic photoinhibition in full sunlight, with severe implications for gas exchange and photosynthetic performance. Excess light severely limited the survival of A. opalus subsp. granatense, even minor reductions of excessive radiation (from full sunlight to 80% sunlight) being crucial for sapling survival. Among species, P. nigra was the most tolerant of high irradiances but showed the poorest shade acclimation. Interspecific differences in the mechanisms of response to light provide a partial explanation of the differential regeneration patterns previously reported for these species, with shade-tolerant plants (i.e., deciduous broadleaf species) benefiting the most from associations with nurse plants. We conclude that light availability is an important environmental factor defining the regeneration niche of Mediterranean woody species.

AB Aims: To study the habitat features affecting the risk of nest predation of birds nesting on the ground or the shrub layer in pyrenean oakwood forests of central Spain, and the variation across different forest areas.
   Location: Four pyrenean oak Quercus pyrenaica forests in the Sistema Central (Madrid, Spain).
   Methods: Estimation of predation rates of artificial wicker nests baited with two quail eggs in four oakwood sites spanning over 700 km(2). Predation rates of individual nests were related, by means of generalized logistic regression models, to different forest locations, habitat features in nest surroundings, and shrub species characteristics where artificial nests were placed.
   Results: Variation in predation pressure was explainable to a low extent by predictor variables (less than 33% of the original deviance). The most remarkable differences in predation pressure were attributable to forest location. Predation risk of artificial nests placed on shrubs decreased with the development of the shrub layer around the nests, and increased in places with a high density of young trees and a large cover of the herbaceous layer. Shrub characteristics related to the probable accessibility of nests did not influence predation risk.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates a small effect of habitat structure of the nest surroundings on the predation risk of nests placed on the ground or shrubs within pyrenean oakwood areas. A trend towards a lower predation pressure was observed in areas with less immature trees and a large shrub cover 10 m around the shrub nests. However, forest tracts where the nests were placed largely determined the predation risk they suffered to an extent not directly associated with habitat structure.

AB The aim is to compare the diversity of the understory in Quercus pyrenaica communities according to the type of human intervention (grazing, obtaining wood or firewood, forest fires). This interaction results in a modification of the characteristics of the arboreal layer and shrub cover. Four types of oak communities were selected, each with five replicates: communities with a high density of shrubby oak (oak shrublands), open woodlands ("dehesas"), mature oak woods with abundant woody biomass in the understory and mature oak woods with little woody biomass in the understory. In each study site, we quantified the size of the trees (height, trunk perimeter and crown diameter) and their density, woody cover in the understory and species richness as well as diversity using the Shannon index, on both a small scale (per m(2)) and for the total of each community. A clear difference was observed between the dehesas and the oak shrublands, the two community types with higher human intervention (the dehesas, with sustainable use for grazing and the oak shrublands, the most degraded due to repeated fires), in the principal components analysis carried out with these variables. The other two community types, considered more mature forests, presented an intermediate location on the principal components analysis. However, there was no clear relationship between the different community types and the diversity values. No differences were observed in total species richness, except that the number of annuals being significantly higher in the dehesas. Nor was it possible to detect any differences using the Shannon index, except for the oak shrublands which, although with a great variability among them, had a lower mean diversity than the other community types. The distance between trees was positively correlated to diversity, measured using the Shannon index, and to annual species richness and negatively correlated to woody cover in the understory. The variability in the distance between trees (associated with clumped distributions) was positively correlated to spatial heterogeneity, measured as S-beta. The size of the trees had very little correlation to species diversity. As a whole, the results obtained show the difficulty involved in making generalised conclusions on the effects of disturbances on plant diversity. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Question: How to improve reforestation success of Quercus pyrenaica.
   Location: 1800 m a.s.l., southern Spain.
   Methods: One-year-old Quercus pyrenaica seedlings were planted using two treatments: (1) bare soil, using a 30-cm diameter augur bit (conventional technique) and (2) under the canopy of a pioneer shrub, Salvia lavandulifolia, using a 12-cm diameter augur bit. Survival and growth were monitored for six years. Our hypothesis is that the use of shrubs as nurse plants is an alternative technique of reforestation with higher success than traditional techniques, in which pre-existing vegetation is usually considered a source of competition. The rationale for the study was that for environments with a dry season, pre-existing vegetation buffers summer drought stress, ameliorates the water status of seedlings and thus usually increases seedling recruitment.
   Results: Quercus survival was 6.3 x higher when planted under individuals of the pioneer shrub as compared to open areas. Quercus seedlings under shrubs also had shoots 1.8 x longer, while the number of shoots per plant did not differ among treatments. The first summer was the period with the highest mortality (49.1 % of seedlings). Summer drought was the main cause of mortality.
   Conclusions: The use of shrubs as nurse plants for Q. pyrenaica reforestation is a viable technique to increase establishment success. The technique could be similarly useful in other environments with a dry period and for other Quercus species. In addition, this technique offers the advantage of following natural succession, thus minimizing the impact in the community.

AB Over many centuries, chestnut fruits had an important role as food, while chestnut wood was used for local purposes. Today sweet chestnut stands are very common around the western Mediterranean Basin, and it is necessary to analyze the dynamic of plant species diversity in different chestnut stand types (groves and coppices) to guide management strategies that will allow the conservation of biodiversity. Our objective was to analyze consequences on plant species diversity of various management strategies in chestnut stands of three Mediterranean areas, Salamanca (Spain), the Cevennes (France), and Etna volcano (Italy). We found that plant species diversity is different according to management types; it is higher in groves than in coppice stands. We also demonstrated that Castanea sativa cultivated groves were characterized by small heliophillous therophytes. C. sativa abandoned groves, mixed C. sativa-Quercus pyrenaica coppice stands, Q. pyrenaica coppice stands, and young C. sativa coppice stands were characterized by hemicryptophytes with anemochorous dispersal mode and chamaephytes. Medium and old C. sativa coppice stands (that differ by the shoot age) were characterized by phanerophytes with zoochorous dispersal mode. Human perturbations maintain a quite high level of species diversity. In contrast, the abandonment of chestnut stands leads to homogeneous vegetation with decreasing diversity. One solution could be to maintain a landscape mosaic constituted of diverse chestnut stands modified by human activities (groves, cultivated or abandoned, and coppice stands). This could enhance regional plant diversity.

AB The N economy of saplings of the Mediterranean Quercus pyrenaica Willd. species was analysed at whole-plant level. The amount and timing of N cycling were determined by strong seasonality in N productivity, which peaked in late spring. Most leaf N was allocated to a main first flush of leaves in early spring, and a minor second flush during early summer or autumn. After peak of N productivity, the allocation of biomass production and N resources was mainly switched to lignotuber and coarse roots. Q. pyrenaica displayed a non-conservative pattern of N use as compared with other co-occurring Quercus species. Potential leaf N-resorption efficiency was moderate, but N proficiency was low, which contributed to high losses of N throughout leaf litter and to short mean residence times of N (MRTN). Additionally, summer water stress reduced foliar area, producing leaf litter with a high N concentration due to almost negligible resorption efficiency, and in some cases, the loss of the whole above-ground fraction. A large investment of plant resources to the root system appeared as a key trait in the N economy and plant fitness of young Q. pyrenaica saplings, allowing them: (1) to counteract N losses and to maintain a positive N balance, (2) to access deep soil resources (water and nutrients), and (3) to 'safe'-store N for coupling supply and demand processes during spring growth or sprouting after a strong summer drought.

With that objective, a parametric characterization of the species actual located biotypes was made measuring 40 plots and 33 ecological parameters and another 14 tree mensuration and sylvicultural ones. This data has allowed to determine physiographic, climatic and edaphic habitat, central and marginal, of Quercus pyrenaica in Galicia. The results shows that this forests are more dry and less productive than Quercus robur and Q. petraea stands, what means abandonment of the traditional uses like firewood and a great fire risk with its sequential degradation. This situation involves a lot difficult to find good stands of Quercus pyrenaica. As summary it could be said that this forests present an altitudinal variation higher to 1000 m, what means an average temperature difference near to 6 C, and the annual precipitation average is 1067.5 mm, being the summer average 115.2 mm, with somewhere summer drought.

An experiment was carried out testing the following treatments: Control, Smoke-5 min, Smoke-10 min, Smoke-15 min, 60 degrees C-5 min, 60 degrees C-15 min, 90 degrees C-5 min, 110 degrees C-5 min, 150 degrees C-5 min, Ash, Ash Dilution and Charcoal. The seed incubation was spread over a year. The germination rates of the Control are very high, especially in Q. ilex. Almost none of the treatments inhibit germination and only the Q. ilex seeds, when subjected to 150 degrees C-5 min, show a marked inhibition. Q. robur and Q. pyrenaica take a year to complete their germination, while Q. ilex only takes 22 weeks. Probably, this reproductive behaviour is related to the climate characteristics to which the species have become adapted. Finally, fire does not determine the germination process, the recruitment of new individuals being independent of fire.

AB Capsule Effects operate during laying and incubation and with less success in breeding territories characterized by a young and immature vegetation structure.
   Aims To explore relationships between habitat characteristics at the breeding territory level and reproductive timing and success of Blue Tits Parus caeruleus in Pyrenean Oak Quercus pyrenaica woods in central Spain.
   Methods Habitat structure of the breeding territories was measured in a sampling plot centred on a nestbox, with a radius of 25 m. A principal component analysis was performed to obtain a factor of 'territory vegetation maturity' summarizing the characteristics of the territory. Reproductive parameters were obtained by frequent visits to the nests during the breeding season. Adults were captured at the nest to obtain morphological measurements, and nestling tarsus length and body mass were measured on day 15 after hatching.
   Results Habitat effects on reproductive performance seem to operate at the beginning of reproduction in these montane oak woods and through female body condition during the first stages of breeding. Female Blue Tits in breeding territories with immature and degraded vegetation started reproduction later and had lower hatching and breeding success. Laying date was strongly related to female body condition. Total reproductive failure occurred mainly during the incubation period and was associated with immature breeding territories. However, nestlings raised in mature forest territories did not differ in size and mass from those in degraded, immature territories.
   Conclusions The effects of habitat structure on Blue Tit reproductive success operate during laying and incubation in this Mediterranean forest type. The results are discussed in terms of the implications of management of Mediterranean oak woods for the conservation of forest bird populations.

AB Mediterranean forests in northern Morocco have been studied. Tree species composition and abundance were investigated in 84 forest sites, distributed throughout the sandstone formation of the Tangier region. The relative abundance of 15 tree and arborescent shrub species was related, by ordination analysis, to altitude, disturbance by fire, and soil fertility. High-elevation forests were dominated by Cedrus atlantica, Quercus pyrenaica and Pinus pinaster. Sacred forests (protected as holy burial places) had a distinct stand structure, and were considered as refuges, for maintaining biodiversity at landscape scale. The evergreen oak Quercus suber and the semideciduous Quercus canariensis co-dominated the lowland forests. The mean basal area of the studied forests was 34 m(2) ha(-1). The mean trunk size (dbh) for Q. suber was 24 cm and for Q. canariensis 36.5 cm; in both cases there were indications of declining regeneration at population level. A comparative biogeographical analysis with the equivalent region in southern Spain (separated by the Strait of Gibraltar; 14 km wide), indicated a possible biodiversity loss in the Moroccan forests.

AB A red wine was matured in contact with 4 g/L of oak wood chips from Portuguese (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.), French (Quercus petraea L.) and a mixture (50:50) of this two oak wood species, during 13 weeks, in order to evaluate the effects of these different oak wood chip species (specially Portuguese oak wood) on the phenolic composition evolution of the wine and in their sensory properties.
   In general, for the phenolic compounds studied, it wasn't possible to detect remarkable differences between the control wine (aged without oak wood chips) and the wines aged in contact with the two oak wood chips species used. However, for non-flavonoid phenols, the presence of oak wood chips contributed to an increase of these compounds in red wines. The influence of oak wood chips in anthocyanins evolution were similar for all wines, except for malvidin-3-glucoside, which decrease was more evident for the wine aged in contact with oak wood chips. The oak wood chips species and the chips concentration used in this study, didn't affect the proanthocyanidin contents in the wines during the time considered.
   Sensory results showed that, the wines aged in contact with Portuguese and French oak wood chips and the mixture of this two oak wood species, differed significantly from the control wine in several sensorial characteristics. The wines aged ill contact with wood chips showed a higher punctuation values for intensity, toasted, wood and vanillin aroma, taste intensity and global appreciation. This positive effect was more evident for wines aged with Portuguese oak wood chips. Probably this results, suggest that the Portuguese oak wood samples species (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) used could be considered suitable for barrel production because it has a positively effect in sensorial red wine attributes. Thus with this Study we tried to contribute for understand the Portuguese oak wood role in red wine characteristics.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the sorption of selected volatile substances from oak wood-chip samples (Quercus pyrenaica Willd. and Quercus petraea L.) subjected to different toasting levels, namely, without toasting, with medium toasting, and with strong toasting, through the use of solid-phase microextraction (SPME). The main volatile compounds identified as a function of the toasting level and botanical species were furfural, hexanal, a-pinene, D-limonene, decanal, vitispirane, ethyl hexanoate, cis-3-methyl-y-octalactone ("oak lactone" or "whisky lactone"), a-terpineol, p-xylene, and nonanal. Considering the data obtained from the toasted woods (medium and strong intensity) in comparison with those of nontoasted woods, it can be pointed out that the average peak area and the number of compounds identified in the gas chromatogram decreased during the toasting process. In general, regarding the compounds analyzed, quantitative differences were found between the two oak wood species under study. High values of volatile compounds were found in Quercus pyrenaica oak wood chips. In addition, for the number of compounds identified in oak wood extracts and directly extracted from solid oak wood chips by SPME, it is concluded that the best extraction process for volatile compounds from oak wood is the use of oak wood-chip liquid extracts.

AB Fungal endophytes in container-grown seedlings in forest nurseries located in the North Plateau of Spain have been studied. Influences of nursery, season (spring and autumn), host genus and plant part on those fungal assemblages have been also evaluated. Four nurseries were sampled in spring and three in autumn. Analysed material consisted of stems, roots and rhizosphere from five host species, Quercus ilex, Q. pyrenaica, Pinus pinea, P. nigra and P. sylvestris. A total of 581 isolates corresponding to 13 taxa were found in this study. Fusarium moniliforme, F. oxysporum and Trichoderma viride were the most frequently isolated fungi. Number of fungal species per observation differed significantly among the sampled parts. Multivariate Correspondence Analysis allowed the discrimination of samples in five groups based on nursery, season, host genus and plant part. Isolation frequencies of F. moniliforme and F. oxysporum were higher in the roots and in spring, whereas those of T. viride were higher in the rhizosphere and in autumn. A relationship was observed between presence of T. viride and absence of Fusarium spp. in forest nurseries. T. viride, could serve as a biological control agent against Fusarium spp. in forest nurseries.

AB About 45% of the total surface area of the Castile and Leon region today can potentially be occupied by semi-deciduous forests, chiefly dominated by Quercus faginea Willd. and Quercus pyrenaica Lam. On the basis of extrapolated trends in annual mean temperature and precipitation in Castile and Leon observed over the 37-year period from 1961 to 1997 [del Rio et al. 2005], predicted changes in the areas covered by Q. faginea and Q. pyrenaica forests in 2025, 2050 and 2075 were made. A decrease in Q. faginea forests may occur if observed trends in temperature and precipitation continue. With respect to Q. pyrenaica forests, they may increase in present Mediterranean areas and decreases in Temperate Submediterranean areas. In some cases, both types of forests could be replaced by deciduous forests. The predicted results in the natural distribution of vegetation types by the bioclimatic models can be used to establish policies for improved future nature conservation and land management.

AB Recent land-use changes in intensively managed forests such as Mediterranean coppice stands might profoundly alter their structure and function. We assessed how the abandonment of traditional management practices in coppice stands, which consisted of short cutting-cycles (10-15 years), has caused overaging (stems are usually much older than when they were coppiced) and altered their wood anatomy and hydraulic architecture. We studied the recent changes of wood anatomy, radial growth, and hydraulic architecture in two stands of Quercus pyrenaica, a transitional Mediterranean oak with ring-porous wood forming coppice stands in W-NW Spain. We selected a xeric and a mesic site because of their contrasting climates and disturbance histories. The xeric site experienced an intense defoliation after the severe 1993-1994 summer drought. The mesic site was thinned in late 1994. We studied the temporal variability in width, vessel number and diameter, and predicted the hydraulic conductivities (K-h) of earlywood and latewood. In the mesic site, we estimated the vulnerability to xylem cavitation of earlywood vessels. Overaging caused a steep decline in latewood production at a cambial age of 14 years., which was close to the customary cutting cycle of Q. pyrenaica. The diameter distribution of vessels was bimodal, and latewood vessels only accounted for 4% of the K-h. Overaging, acting as a predisposing factor in the decline episode, was observed at the xeric site, where most trees did not produce latewood in 1993-1995. At the mesic site, thinned trees formed wider tree-rings, more latewood and multiseriate tree-rings than overaged trees. The growth enhancement remained 8 years after thinning. Most of the hydraulic conductivity in earlywood was lost in a narrow range of potentials, between -2.5 and -3.5 MPa. We have shown how hydraulic conductivity and radial growth are closely related in Q. pyrenaica and how aging modulates this relationship.

Small defect-free samples were used, applying the methodology established by UNE-AENOR (1978) for testing wood samples. Conclusions were reached about the different behaviour of the three species after comparison of each of the parameters studied in relation to the position on the stem.

AB Spatial heterogeneity of abiotic factors influences patterns of seedling establishment at different scales. In stress-prone ecosystems such as Mediterranean ones, heterogeneity generated by shrubs has been shown to facilitate the establishment of tree species. However, how this facilitation is affected by spatial scale remains poorly understood. We have experimentally analysed the consequences of the abiotic heterogeneity generated by pioneer shrubs on survival, growth and physiology of seedlings of three important tree species from Mediterranean mountains (Acer opalus ssp. granatense, Quercus pyrenaica and Quercus ilex). Patterns of abiotic heterogeneity and seedling performance were studied at two scales differing in grain: 1) the microhabitat scale, by using open interspaces as controls of the effect of different shrub species, and 2) the microsite scale, analysing the effects of fine-grain heterogeneity (within-microhabitat heterogeneity). Results showed that, at the microhabitat scale, seedling establishment of the three tree species significantly benefited from the modification of the abiotic environment by nurse shrubs. However, we found shrub-seedling interactions to be species-specific, due to differential modification of both aboveground (light availability) and belowground (soil compaction, water content, and fertility) abiotic factors by nurse shrub species. Heterogeneity at the within-microhabitat scale was rather high, although it did not significantly affect seedling performance of any of the tree species. The study demonstrates that the effects of the abiotic heterogeneity generated by shrubs are not consistent across the range of spatial scales considered. The regeneration niche of tree species becomes very complex at fine spatial scales, and thereby estimators of abiotic heterogeneity are valuable descriptors of spatial patterns of seedling establishment only when microsite "noise" is averaged out at greater scales.

AB Oaks are long- standing models for the study of gene flow and hybridisation. Temperate ( Quercus petraea) and sub-Mediterranean ( Quercus pyrenaica) oaks coexist in central Spain, showing remarkable differences in population size and structure. Q. petraea has a scattered distribution in central Spain, where it is at one of the southernmost limits of its range, and forms low- density stands; in contrast, Q. pyrenaica is widespread in the region. We selected a mixed population of the two species ( similar to 13 ha, 176 adults and 96 saplings) to compare the patterns of gene flow within each species and the extent of introgression between them. Using five nuclear microsatellite markers, we performed a parentage analysis and found considerable immigration from outside the stand ( similar to 38% for Q. petraea and similar to 34% for Q. pyrenaica), and estimated average seed- dispersal distances of 42 and 14 m for Q. petraea and Q. pyrenaica, respectively. Introgression between species was also estimated using our microsatellite battery. First, we developed a multivariate discriminant approach and, second, we compared our results with a widely used clustering method ( STRUCTURE). Both analyses were consistent with a low level of introgression between Q. petraea and Q. pyrenaica. Indeed, only 15 adult trees, similar to 8.5%, were identified as putative hybrids when both methods of analysis were combined. Hybrids may be most common in contact zones due merely to physical proximity.

AB The epiphytic bryoflora growing on trunks of Quercus pyrenaica Willd. and Q. robur L. has been surveyed throughout an extended area in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. Seventy four species are catalogued (14 liverworts and 60 mosses) with an indication of their distribution in the area. Knowledge of the regional flora is supplemented with a total of 44 novelties for 7 of the 8 provinces considered. Substrate affinity for several facultative epiphytes is discussed on the basis of their frequency on bark. The distribution of regionally rare species such as Harpalejeunea molleri, Metzgeria fruticulosa, M. temperata, Orthotrichum consimile, O. scanicum, O. shawii, Ulota coarctata and Zygodon viridissimus is used in conjunction with overall species richness and the degree to which they are representative of the regional flora to assess the local significance of the different localities and to select a list of hotspots for conservation.

AB Spatio-temporal variability of recharge (R) and groundwater evapotranspiration (ETg) fluxes in a granite Sardon catchment in Spain (similar to 80 km(2)) have been assessed based on integration of various data sources and methods within the numerical groundwater MODFLOW model. The data sources and methods included: remote sensing solution of surface energy balance using satellite data, sap flow measurements, chloride mass balance, automated monitoring of climate, depth to groundwater table and river discharges, 1D reservoir modeling, GIS modeling, field cartography and aerial photo interpretation, slug and pumping tests, resistivity, electromagnetic and magnetic resonance soundings.
   The presented study case provides not only detailed evaluation of the complexity of spatio-temporal variable fluxes, but also a complete and generic methodology of modern data acquisition and data integration in transient groundwater modeling for spatio-temporal groundwater balancing.
   The calibrated numerical model showed spatially variable patterns of R and ETg fluxes despite a uniform rainfall pattern. The seasonal variability of fluxes indicated: (1) R in the range of 0.3-0.5 mm/d within similar to 8 months of the wet season with exceptional peaks as high as 0.9 mm/d in January and February and no recharge in July and August; (2) a year round stable lateral groundwater outflow (Q(g)) in the range of 0.08-0.24 mm/d; (3) ETg 0.64, 0.80, 0.55 mm/d in the dry seasons of 1997, 1998, 1999, respectively, and < 0.05 mm/d in wet seasons; (4) temporally variable aquifer storage, which gains water in wet seasons shortly after rain showers and looses water in dry seasons mainly due to groundwater evapotranspiration.
   The dry season sap flow measurements of tree transpiration performed in the homogenous stands of Quercus ilex and Quercus pyrenaica indicated flux rates of 0.40 and 0.15 mm/d, respectively. The dry season tree transpiration for the entire catchment was similar to 0.16 mm/d. The availability of dry season transpiration measurements considered as root groundwater uptake (T-g), allowed estimation of dry season catchment groundwater evaporation (E-g) as 0.48, 0.64, 0.39 mm/d for 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively.

ID SORPTION
AB The reduction of wood response to variations of ambient humidity, described as kind of ageing, has been studied from both points of view of moisture uptake and dimensional changes. Clearwood specimens from 3 gymnosperms (Pinus sylvestris L., Pinus pinaster Ait., Pinus insignis Dougl) and 4 angiosperms (Populus spp., Quercus pyrenaica Willd., Entandrophragma cylindricum Sprague, Chlorophora excelsa Benth. & Hook f.) were subjected to five wet-dry cycles and their moisture content and dimensional changes in radial and tangential direction at three increasing levels of relative humidity ( 57.6, 84.2 and 90.2%) were measured before and after the treatment. For a given increase of relative humidity, a coefficient of hygroscopic ageing was defined as the relative decrease of moisture uptake, and the coefficient of dimensional ageing as the difference of swelling strain before and after ageing. All species exhibited a clear ageing effect, much stronger in the wet range than in the dry range. Calculation of swelling coefficients suggested that in some cases the relation between swelling strain and moisture content is no longer linear in aged wood.

AB This paper presents a growth model for dominant-height and site-quality estimations for Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) stands. The Bertalanffy-Richards function is used with the generalized algebraic difference approach to derive a dynamic site equation. This allows dominant-height and site-index estimations in a compatible way, using any desirable base age and allowing estimations to be time independent, which are important properties for site models. The database contains all possible height-growth intervals. The model is fitted considering residual autocorrelation, giving more efficient parameter estimates. Finally, the model behavior is analyzed by calculating error statistics from dominant-height and site-index estimations at different ages.

AB In the present work we analyse the hydrological processes characterising a forested catchment on the northern face of the Sistema Central range. The Rinconada experimental catchment (at Rinconada de la Sierra, province ofSalamanca), which has been running since autumn 1999, is mainly occupied by a dense forest of semi-deciduous oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.). It is equipped with different experimental devices (automatic meteorological and hydrological stations, a soil moisture measurement network, plots to monitor plant water dynamics, interception control networks) for the monitoring of the variables involved in the soil-water-plant-atmosphere system. The results of the analysis reveal the crucial role of the forest in the hydrological dynamics of the catchment. The catchment has a low capacity to generate runoff, above all during the period coinciding with the biological activity of the oaks. Factors such as low summer rainfall, high evapotranspiration, interception and water consumption by the trees mean that the catchment produces very little runoff, even though it is subject to subhumid climatic conditions. Also important is the fact that the saturated areas, even though occupying a very reduced percentage of the catchment, are determinant in the generation of the runofffrom the majority of the events.

AB Genetic variability of species can appear due to different ecological factors, such as the position they occupy within vegetal communities. From an area in the southern Iberian Peninsula where I great number of species of the genus Quercus are found, we report the influence or winds on their chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) composition, Quercus faginea behaves as the genetic receiver of Q. canariensis, producing the hybrid Q. canariensis x Q. faginea, which is important in the landscape. Both species and the hybrid have a suitable altitudinal location for the pollen route, favoured by eastern winds. Quercus pyrenaica forests are protected from the eastern winds so they receive pollen from Q. lusitanica, favoured by western winds. The hybrids between Q. canarietisis and Q. faginea are morphologically identifiable, while the introgressions between Q. lusitanica and Q. pyrenaica are not. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

AB In the present work we analyse runoff yield in a small Mediterranean basin with respect to soil moisture dynamics. The aim was to observe the behaviour of the basin in terms of the generation of runoff in periods in which maximum water deficit occurs in the soil. Despite the abundant precipitation in the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean area, the joint action of the climatic conditions prevailing in the growing season and water interception and consumption by the forest may seriously affect the generation of runoff over a considerable part of the year.

AB The composition, abundance, and species richness of epiphytic communities on Quercusfaginea Lam., Quercus pyrenaica Willd., and Quercus rotundifolia Lam. was examined in native woodlands in distinct sites of Centre and Northern Portugal, included in the Natura 2000 Network. The dependence upon a number of environmental variables was investigated in thirteen sites in Portugal. Sixty one bryophytes (50 mosses, 11 liverworts) were found in the plots along thirteen sites. Multivariate analysis was used to examine the epiphytic bryophyte composition of these woodlands. Relationships between bryophyte and lichen community composition, climate and stational variables were examined using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). The total biodiversity found in the sites surveyed, including branches and other phorophytes associated with Quercus spp. was about I I I bryophyte taxa.

AB For the first time in Portugal, simple variables describing the vertical structure and the composition of forests on the Portuguese mainland were included in the 2258 sample plots of the National Forest Inventory (DGF 2001). The vertical forest structure was assessed by percentage cover of seven height. classes and the composition of the different layers was described using plant species, or groups of plant species, easily identifiable in the field.
   Cluster analysis, in particular K-means statistics, was performed using combinations of vertical structure and compositional data, resulting in ten main natural groups or forest types: 1) Quercus pyrenaica forests; 2) Other deciduous oak forests; 3) Arbutus unedo forests; 4) Cistus shrubs; 5) Cytisus shrubs; 6) Acacia forests; 7) Quercus suber forests; 8) Pinus pinaster forests; 9) Eucalyptus forests; and 10) Other forests. The last four groups were further subdivided according to the vertical structure resulting in twenty final forest types. The geographical distribution of these forests types and the implications for biodiversity and other forest issues are presented and discussed.

AB Sensitive indicators of soil quality that reflect the effects of land management on soil are needed in order to promote long-term sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems. Our objective was to assess changes in soil quality due to the effects of plant cover (C sativa vs. Q. pyrenaica) and different chestnut management (coppice for wood vs. orchard for fruit) on selected soil quality parameters. Significant differences between the chestnut sites occurred for some biochemical properties reflecting a higher soil bacterial activity in the chestnut coppice than in the orchard. In general, soil parameters in the oak (Q. pyrenaica) stand were similar to its adjacent chestnut orchard with the exception of available soil P content and acid-phosphatase activity (APA), that in turn were more closely related to the chestnut coppice. The higher acid-phosphatase activity in the chestnut coppice and oak stand could be explained by a combination of both soil bacterial activity and plant root production of this enzyme due to decreased soil P content in these two sites.

AB Knowledge of wood properties is essential in determining the specific uses to which the wood can be put. The physical and mechanical properties of rebollo oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) make it highly suitable for use in the construction and furniture-making industries. It is greatly appreciated for its appearance and hardness and uses, similar to Atlantic oak wood (Quercus robur and Q. petraea), having been used for barrel staves, pit props and railway sleepers. However, at present the Quercus pyrenaica coppice forests in Galicia are predominantly used to produce high quality firewood and charcoal, and the acorns are sometimes harvested for feeding livestock.
   The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships between certain physical and mechanical properties of the wood and distance from pith to bark and how geographical altitude affects these properties.

AB Fungal assemblages present in nursery seedlings were surveyed, aimed to evaluate influences of site, season, host and plant part. Four sampling sites were selected; three of them were sampled twice, in spring and autumn. Needles/leaves and stems were collected from five host species: Quercus ilex, Q. pyrenaica, Pinus pinea, P nigra, and P sylvestris and surf ace-sterilized with sodium hypochlorite. A total of 1557 fungal strains, pertaining to 59 'species' or morphological types, were recovered. The dominant species, with higher isolation frequencies were Alternaria alternata complex, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Phoma sp., Clonostachys rosea, Ulocladium sp., Trichothecium roseum, Cytospora leucosperma, and Rhizopus sp. Median values of fungal species per observation differed significantly among the sites. The diversity of fungal species was significantly higher in the spring, and isolation frequencies for most of the dominant species were also dependent on the season, however the number of isolates per sampling was not influenced by the season. The results showed that the most frequent species (Alternaria alternata complex and Cladosporium cladosporioides) were associated with autumn observations, whereas higher frequencies of saprobic fungi (Aspergillus niger, Ulocladium sp. and Cytospora sp.) were found in spring.

DE experimental burning; revegetation; Erica australis shrubland;
   succession
ID SPAIN
AB The effect of revegetation with different combinations of native species in the recovery dynamic of a shrubland dominated by Erica australis subjected to experimental fire was studied. The herbs sown had very low cover throughout the study period. Amongst the species of shrubs, Cytisus spp. develops cover above 50% from the fourth year after sowing in the plots where it was sown and colonisation is observed in the unsown ones from the ninth year. Quercus pyrenaica seedlings have a survival rate of 50%, but their mean height does not reach 40 cm after nine years. The shrub and herbaceous species present in the area before experimental burning are characterised by their great resilience, resprouting vegetatively or recovering from seed. It is therefore not possible to detect significant differences among the plots subjected to the different revegetation treatments and the controls regarding woody, herbaceous or total cover, nor are any significant differences observed in the diversity counted as number of species (richness). The good development of Cytisus spp. points to an important physiognomic change and this, together with the high survival rate, although not growth so far, of Q. pyrenaica may influence the long-term dynamic of the community.

ID QUERCUS-ILEX L; GROWTH-RESPONSE; STAND STRUCTURE
AB Coppices are currently at a turning point: traditional uses have been abandoned and silviculture must be redefined according to new uses. Thinning to improve the development of trees is often the silvicultural treatment chosen. This paper attempts to assess the changes in forest structural diversity induced by different thinning regimes applied in coppice stands of Quercus pyrenaica and Quercus faginea. Structural diversity is analysed through spatial pattern, crown dimensions, vertical and horizontal differentiation and foliage height diversity. Moderate and heavy thinning have similar effects on stand structure, but the effects of light thinning are quite different for both species. The spatial pattern shows a greater regularity as the intensity of the thinning regime increases. The response of Q. pyrenaica to thinning is noticeable both in tree height and crown diameter, whilst in the case of Q. faginea, trees reacted to thinning by developing epicormic sprouts on the stem from the base of the crown. Vertical differentiation shows opposite trends in both species: increasing the intensity of thinning leads to an increase in vertical differentiation with Q. pyrenaica, but to a greater homogenisation shortly after thinning with Q. faginea. A neighbourhood analysis using Gadow's differentiation index is able to provide useful information on the changes in microstructure, while foliage height diversity index can be used to describe complex changes in the vertical structure of the stand.

AB Twenty-two samples of leaves and flowers of six Mediterranean browse species (Erica australis, Quercus pyrenaica, Cistus laurifolius, Cytisus scoparius, Genista florida and Rosa canina) were analysed for total extractable phenols (TP), extractable tannins (ET) and condensed tannins (CTb (butanol/HCI assay) and CTv (vanillin assay)). The biological activity of the phenolic compounds was assessed as the increases in in vitro dry matter digestibility and gas production after in vitro incubation in rumen fluid following the addition of polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG). The concentrations of phenolics and tannins varied with species, sampling time and part of the plant (leaves or flowers). There were also large differences in the values determined by different analytical methods. The highest correlation coefficients (P < 0.001) were found between TP and ET (r = 0.973) and between CTb and CTv (r = 0.758). However, only low correlations were observed between TP and CTh or CTv. Positive and significant (P < 0.01) correlations were observed between tannins and their biological activity determined as the effect of PEG on gas production. It is concluded that, although further research is required to develop methods for the accurate quantification of biologically active tannins, the effect of PEG on in vitro gas production seems to have promising potential for the assessment of phenolic-related antinutritive effects in browse plants. This technique, coupled with other tannin assays, could provide a better understanding of the nutritional and physiological significance of tannins. (C) 2004 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB Two canopy properties, leaf area index (LAI) and covered ground (CoverGnd), were estimated using hemispherical photography of three oak (Quercus pyrenaica) and eight pine (Pinus sylvestris) forest plots in Sierra de Guadarrama (central Spain). Pulses from airborne laser scanner (Lidar) that hit the surface on the exact location (within centimeter resolution) of the photographs were analyzed and separated by different radius size (from 0.5 to 20m). The correlation between Lidar and hemispherical photography estimates of canopy properties was highly significant, but was affected by the type of forest and the radius size. CoverGnd was better estimated using a small radius size (2.5 m, equivalent to one fourth of canopy height), while LAI was better estimated using a larger radius size (7.5-12.5 m, equivalent to the entire canopy height). In general, the smaller the tree, the shorter the radius was that must be used to select Lidar data, and the best Lidar estimator of canopy properties was the percentage of canopy hits. Overall oak canopies showed better results than pine forest. The poorer estimation in pine forest plots was probably due to the larger foliage and branch clumping of pine versus oak canopies. Lidar data could be used to produce high-resolution regional maps of the canopy properties studied. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The endogenous frost resistance of the seeds of four Mediterranean oaks (Quercus coccifera, Q. faginea, Q. ilex and Q. pyrenaica) with different leaf abscission phenology was tested. Thermal analysis and polyelectrolytes leakage methodologies were employed to establish lethal temperature thresholds. Results showed a higher frost resistance for evergreen species and lower for deciduous species in this decreasing order: Q. coccifera, Q. ilex, Q. faginea and Q. pyrenaica. The cover of leaf litter generated by deciduous species could be an isolating element which allowed seed survival under cold winter conditions to that species with a lower frost resistance. Differences in temperature above and below a leaf litter cover along a winter season were measured in a Q. faginea stand, in this sense the kind effect of leaf litter from a thermal point of view was proved.

AB A field mycorrhization was carried out in a relatively small reforested area of the Natural Park of Urkiola (northern Spain), where three fungal inoculum (Scleroderma citrinum Pers., Pisolithus arhizus (Scop.: Pers.) Rauschert and Leccinum scabrum (Bull.: Fr.) Gray) were used with broadleaf seedlings. The tree species used were beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) and birch (Betula celtiberica Rothm. & Vasc.). In accordance with our results, the field mycorrhization can be considered successful since later one some ectomycorrhizae and carpophores of the fungal species used were found in the experimental plot. Likewise, the data obtained from the measured variables, such as height, root collar diameter, leaf area, amount and type of chlorophylls, carbohydrate content and fluorescence in leaves, indicate that the inoculated seedlings, in many cases, were in better condition than the control ones. The inoculum used S. citrinum was the best suited fungus for Q. pyrenaica and F sylvatica, while L. scabrum was best for birch seedlings. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study was designed to evaluate the litter produced by Mediterranean shrub legumes subjected to two conditions of aridity. Seasonal litterfall patterns and litter chemistry showed no significant variation with soil aridity. The effects of aridity on the amount of litter produced were related to the plant species. A higher availability of water led to a 110% increase in litter production by Colutea arborescens (3191 vs. 1516 kg ha(-1)) and to a 24% increase for Medicago strasseri (5288 vs. 4258 kg ha(-1)). The litter provided by Colutea cilicica failed to significantly increase (1651 vs. 1825 kg ha(-1)) in less and conditions. In our experimental conditions, Dorycnium hirsutum showed high mortality and scarce persistence. In general, the litter supplied by these shrub legumes was low in lignin and showed high levels of easily degradable organic-C. Its N content, in the range 18 to 26.5 g kg(-1) was similar to that described by others for multipurpose tropical legumes. Under the semi-arid conditions of central Spain, C. arborescens and C. cilicica gave rise to potential yearly returns of 662 and 693 kg ha(-1) organic-C, and 35 and 44 kg ha(-1) N, respectively. M. strasseri provided a yearly organic-C return (1742 kg ha(-1)) similar to that of a mature Mediterranean wood, and to a potential N return (78 kg ha(-1)) that substantially exceeded this reference. Compared to the sclerophyllous species typical of the Mediterranean environment, shrub legumes show a much greater potential for enhancing N and organic-C levels, and consequently, for improving the biological activity of degraded soils. This feature is thought to be associated with the rapid and constant renewal of their leaves and their ability to provide the soil with other easily degraded materials.

AB Changes in leaf mass per area (LMA), nitrogen content on a mass-basis (N-m) and on an area basis (N-a) with relative irradiance were assessed in leaves of eight temperate species harvested at different depths in a canopy. Relative irradiance (GSF) at the points of leaf sampling was estimated by hemispheric photographs. There was a strong species-dependent positive relationship between LMA and GSF for all species. Shade-tolerant species such as Fagus sylvatica showed lower LMA for the same GSF than less tolerant species as Quercus pyrenaica or Quercus petraea. The only evergreen species in the study, Ilex aquifollium, had the highest LMA, independent of light environment, with minimum values much higher than the rest of the broad-leaved species studied. There was no relation between N and GSF for most species studied and only a very weak relation for the relative shade-intolerant species Q. pyrenaica. Within each species, the pattern of Na investment with regard to GSF was linked mainly to LMA. At the same relative irradiance, differences in N. among species were conditioned both by the LMA-GSF relationship and by the species N value. The lowest N-m value was measured in I. aquifollium (14.3 +/- 0.6 mg g(-1)); intermediate values in Crataegus monogyna (16.9 +/- 0.6 mg g(-1)) and Prunus avium (19.1 +/- 0.6 mg g(-1)) and higher values, all in a narrow range (21.3 +/- 0.6 to 23 +/- 0.6 mg g(-1)), were measured for the other five species. Changes in LMA with the relative irradiance were linked both to lamina thickness (LT) and to palisade/spongy parenchyma ratio (PP/SP). In the second case, the LMA changes may be related to an increase in lamina density as palisade parenchyma involves higher cell packing than spongy parenchyma. However, since PP/SP ratio showed a weak species-specific relationship with LMA, the increase in LT should be the main cause of LMA variation. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the growth response of coppice forest of Quercus pyrenaica Willd. to thinnings of different intensities. Four treatments were tested: light, moderate and heavy thinning with respectively 25, 35 and 50% of basal area removed, and no thinning (control). The results obtained show significant differences between treatments for diameter and biomass of the mean tree and for current diameter increment, for the three inventories carried out (1994, 1998, 2002). The largest values for the mean tree were observed with the heaviest thinning treatment. No differences were found between treatments for stand yield (total basal area and biomass). Stand structure appears more regular in thinned plots, reducing the risk of forest fires and increasing the landscape and recreation values and the possibility of silvopastoral use.

AB Many biotic and abiotic factors affect seedling establishment in woody plants. In Mediterranean environments, the major factors affecting tree regeneration are light, water, and herbivory. We investigated the response of some morphological and chemical traits of Quercus pyrenaica Willd. seedlings to simulated herbivory (hand removal of 50% of the aerial mass) and two levels of light (sun vs. shade) and water (one vs. two waterings). Water had no appreciable direct effect on morphological or chemical traits. Shaded seedlings grew less but had greater total leaf area. Simulated herbivory decreased the total leaf area, and root and aerial mass. Among the chemical characteristics, shaded seedlings had higher levels of nitrogen and lower levels of condensed tannins. In colorimetric assays of tannins, clipped seedlings had lower absorbances than did unclipped plants, and this effect was more pronounced in the sun than in the shade. Our experiment shows that light availability and herbivory affect the development and defence of Q. pyrenaica seedlings. Although Q. pyrenaica tolerated shade and simulated herbivory, both factors decreased biomass and chemical defence, which could affect the seedlings' future performance.

AB Various pollen sequences from lacustrine deposits close to Lago de Sanabria (NW Iberia) have for several decades been a key source of information for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of SW Europe, though their interpretation has been the subject of some controversy. Here we present two new pollen sequences obtained from this area, and a new palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of the region. The available pollen data reach back to before 18,000 B.P., a period of very harsh climate with seasonal (non continuous) sedimentation and a landscape characterised by herbaceous formations dominated by Gramineae and Artemisia, and scrub formations dominated by Ericaceae and Cistaceae. Subsequently sedimentation became continuous, and various regional forest expansions are apparent. At a local level, the first forest expansion began about 12,000 B.P., when Betula pollen reached 70% followed by peaks in Pinus sylvestris-type (>80%) and Quercus robur-type (40%). The Younger Dryas saw a retreat of woodland formations in the area around the lake, with broadleaved deciduous woodland (largely oak) retreating at mid and low altitudes, but with pine woodland persisting in more sheltered sites. The climatic improvement in the Early Holocene favoured re-expansion of woodland, dominated by Pinus sylvestris-type at higher and Quercus robur and Q. pyrenaica at lower altitudes, until anthropogenic deforestation commenced around 4,000 B.P. The disappearance of natural pine woodlands in this region is probably largely attributable to human interference.

AB Samples of leaves, flowers and fruits of four browse species were collected from uplands in the province of Leon (northwestern Spain) at different sampling times (from spring till autumn). The browse species were Erica australis (Spanish heath), Cistus laurifolius (laurel-leaved rock rose), Quercus pyrenaica (hoary oak) and Rosa canina (wild dog rose). A large variability in chemical composition and in vitro digestibility and gas production kinetics was observed among species and among sampling times within each species. The ranking order of the browse plants according to their in vitro digestibility and gas production kinetics was R canina > Q pyrenaica > C laurifolius > E australis. In the leaves of R canina and Q pyrenaica, crude protein content, digestibility and parameters of gas production tended to decrease throughout the growing season (P < 0.05 in most cases), whereas cell wall contents followed the opposite trend. Seasonal variations were less pronounced in the other browse species. There were significant (P < 0.05) correlations between in vitro digestibility and chemical composition of the browse plants, positive with the crude protein content and negative with the fibre fractions.

AB We examined the occurrence of carabid beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) at the edges of oak (Quercus pyrenaica) and beech (Fagus sylvatica) forests in Leon, NW Spain. Pitfall traps were used to collect beetles from April to October 2002, and leaf litter cover and depth were measured. Traps were placed at three distances (0, 50 and 100 in) from the edges of eight forest patches. A total of 5436 carabids belonging to 43 species were collected. We found no statistically significant edge effect at the carabid assemblage level, i.e. the number of species and individuals was not higher at the edge compared to the forest interior. However, individual species were affected by distance from the edge. Five of the 14 species analysed responded predictably to the edge, three of them statistically significantly so. Four species did not respond in the predicted direction, two of them statistically significantly so. We found a considerable difference between forest types in terms of carabid assemblage composition and response to the edge. Oak forests were species richer and beech forests had a higher number of individuals. These differences were probably due to small-scale habitat heterogeneity in the oak forest patches, caused by man, and the homogeneous structure of beech forests. Leaf litter appeared to be one possible factor influencing the distribution of some species from the interior to the edge of forests.

SO FORESTRY

DT Article
ID HERBACEOUS VEGETATION; FAGUS-SYLVATICA; LEAF-AREA; ESTABLISHMENT; GROWTH
AB El Chaparral de Montejo is a woodland area situated in central Spain containing a large group of temperate species that since the Middle Ages has been subject to communal use for grazing like many other European forests. We studied the characteristics of former wood-pasture and the pole-stage stands developed close to ancient trees in three representative stands consisting of Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea and Quercus pyrenaica. The Fagus sylvatica stand proved to be the best regeneration site because of its deep soil and greater number of ancient trees, which provided more seeds and tree cover, both favouring the development of seedlings in this stand. However, the poorer soil conditions and the dense layer of herbaceous vegetation in the Quercus pyrenaica stand have inhibited the establishment of the more water-demanding temperate species. It is suggested that past irregular exploitation conducted to a mosaic distribution of forest communities explain the differences in structure and composition found in the three stands studied. The stand occupied by the more xerophilous species, Quercus pyrenaica, was more affected by the reduction of forest productivity in the past. Nowadays the patterns of pole-stage stand diversity reveal the future expected changes. The higher diversity of saplings in the Quercus petraea and Quercus pyrenaica stands reveal better conditions in the understorey than those existing in their early developmental stages, especially for the two shade-tolerant species, beech and holly. On the contrary the lower diversity of saplings in the Fagus sylvatica stand is due to the low light levels in the understorey which gradually cause the disappearance of shade-intolerant species.

AB The use of black oak woodlands (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) by small ruminant flocks was investigated in northeastern Portugal. In their daily grazing itineraries, the animals crossed a large and heterogeneous set of vegetation patches, returning to their corrals every night. Two goat flocks and two sheep flocks led by shepherds were surveyed monthly from May 1999 to May 2000. A hand rover Global Position System (GPS), recording time, geographical position and land cover, monitored shepherding paths every two minutes. The utilization of black oak woodlands was analyzed by three different approaches:
   1) time spent by the flocks at black oak woodlands in relation to total time of itineraries,
   2) relation of time spent at black oak woodlands and time spent crossing them, and
   3) the contribution of black oak to flock diets.
   GPS data revealed changes in black oak woodlands utilization among seasons and/or kind of flocks. Diet estimation indicated also differences in the intensity and sort of black oak woodlands consumption related to kind of animal and season over the course of the year.

AB We assessed the response of Quercus ilex subsp. ballota to the severe summer drought recorded in 1994 in NE Spain through the study of changes in radial growth and wood anatomy. We selected a coppice stand in the Iberian Peninsula, which is characterized by a Mediterranean climate under continental influence. We measured internode length, tree-ring width, mean and maximum vessel diameter, and vessel density for 1981-1997. The annual predicted hydraulic conductance (K-h) was calculated following Hagen-Poisseuille's law. We compared the tree-ring width, vessel diameter and K-h of Q. ilex subsp. ballota and co-existing ring-porous oaks (Q. faginea, Q. pyrenaica) for a dry summer (1994) and a wet summer (1997). To evaluate the drought-resistance of xylem for Q. ilex subsp. ballota (dominant under continental conditions) and Q. ilex subsp. ilex (dominant in mild areas) we determined vulnerability curves. Dimensionless indices of internode length, tree-ring width, and vessel density were compared with climatic data (monthly total precipitation and mean temperature) using correlation analyses. Internode length, tree-ring width, K-h, and mean and maximum vessel diameter declined in 1994. According to vulnerability curves, Q. ilex subsp. ballota showed a greater drought resistance than Q. ilex subsp. ilex. During the year of growth, we found a positive influence of January and June-August precipitation on the internode length, tree-ring width, and vessel density. The response of Q. ilex subsp. ballota radial-growth to summer drought was comparable to that of Q. faginea latewood. Overall, growth and wood anatomy of Q. ilex subsp. ballota showed a plastic response to drought.

AB A red Rioja wine was aged in barrels made of Spanish oak wood (Quercus robur, Quercus petraea, Quercus pyrenaica, and Quercus faginea) during 21 months. The concentrations of some volatile compounds [syringaldehyde, vanillin, eugenol, maltol, guaiacol, 4-ethylphenol, cis and trans isomers of beta-methyl-gamma-octalactone, 2-furfuraldehyde, 5-methyl-2-furfuraidehyde, 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-furfuraldehyde, and furfuryl alcohol] were studied in these wines and compared with those of the same wine aged in barrels made from French oak of Q. robur(Limousin, France) and Q. petraea (Allier, France) and American oak of Quercus alba (Missouri). Similar concentrations of these compounds were found in wines aged in Spanish and French oak wood barrels, and significantly different concentrations were found with respect to wines aged in barrels made of American oak wood, indicating a different behavior. Thus, wines with different characteristics were obtained, depending on the kind of wood. Also, the kind of wood had an important influence on sensory characteristics of wine during the aging process. Spanish oak wood from Q. robur, Q. petraea, and Q. pyrenaica can be considered to be suitable for barrel production for quality wines, because a wine aged in barrels made of these Spanish oak woods showed similar and intermediate characteristics to those of the same wine aged in French and American oak woods usually used in cooperage.

AB Annual production of litter by Cistus incanus (L.) and Myrtus communis (L.) and decomposition dynamics of leaf litter of these species was studied in a Mediterranean shrubland. Myrtus and Cistus produced 472 and 429 g dry weight litter m(-2) year(-1), respectively. Leaves were the predominant litter component for both species. The average decay constant of Myrtus and Cistus litters enclosed in litter bags, calculated over the whole study period (38 months), was 0.71 year(-1) and 0.31 year(-1) respectively. In green leaves the N content differed during growth seasons for both species, whereas the content of Ca, Mg, P, K, and Na did not show significant changes. Abscised leaves had lower N, P and K contents than green leaves, evidencing that a nutrient translocation before abscission occurred from senescent leaves. The nutrient contents of the leaves at abscission time, generally higher in Cistus than in Myrtus, allowed us to estimate the annual nutrient input to the soil. Phosphorus and K more than N were rapidly released by the decomposing litters after exposure. Nutrient limitation, in particular P, might be considered the main growth limiting factor for Myrtus and Cistus. Both species were adapted to recovery and rapidly recycle P more than N and K in the living biomass through retranslocation from green leaves before abscission and/or a high release rate from the decomposing litter. The former strategy was better used by Cistus, the latter by Myrtus.

AB The effects of wildfire on vegetation regeneration in communities dominated by Quercus pyrenaica and those dominated by Pinus pinaster in NW Spain were compared. In order to study changes in the composition and structure of both types of community, permanent plots were established in areas dominated by Q. pyrenaica and those dominated by P. pinaster. All were burned by wildfires at the end of summer. In each plot a permanent transect of 20 m x I m was established. Basal cover of the plant species present was analysed. In both types of community the global cover values generally increased throughout the study period. In the oak communities the species that appear in the first years are those that will dominate in the mature stage, like Q. pyrenaica and Erica australis. Both species are typical resprouters: from shoots on the rhizome or the stem of subterranean roots in the case of Q. pyrenaica and from lignotubers in the case of E. australis. Among the other species, herbaceous perennials dominated during the first year after the fire, Luzula lactea being the most representative. The percentage of bare soil decreased very rapidly after the first year of regeneration. However, in the P. pinaster communities the species that appeared with higher cover values during the first and second year after fire were seeders, like R pinaster and Halimium alyssoides. Other species that appeared in these communities were Chamaespartium tridentatum, and E. australis. Amongst the herbaceous perennials, the most representative species was the Liliacea Ornithogalum umbellatum, which appeared throughout the study period in all the burned plots. The percentages of bare soil were higher than in the oak communities. Structural parameters such as diversity and specific richness were much higher in the community dominated by oak than in the pine stand. In general, regeneration after wildfire in the Pinus community was slower than in oak communities. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was (i) to characterize different species of Quercus genus and (ii) to discriminate among them on the basis of the content and fatty acid composition of the oil in their fruits and/or their morphological aspects via pattern recognition techniques (Principal Component Analysis, PCA, Cluster Analysis, CA, and Discriminant Analysis, DA). Quercus rotundifolia Lam., Quercus suber L. and Quercus pyrenaica Willd., grown in the same stand in the centre of Portugal, were investigated.
   When oil content and respective fatty acid composition were used to characterize samples, well-separated groups corresponding to each of the species were observed by PCA and confirmed by CA and DA. The "width" and "length" of acorns exhibited a low discriminant power. Acorns from Q. rotunditolia showed the highest average oil content followed by. Q. suber and Q. pyrenaica acorns (9.1, 5.2 and 3.8%, respectively). Fatty acid profiles of Q. rotundifolia and Q. suber oils are similar to olive oil while the oil from Q. pyrenaica acorns is more unsaturated.

AB We studied stomatal responses to decreasing predawn water potential (Psi(pd)) and increasing leaf-to-air water vapor pressure difference (VPD) of co-occurring woody Mediterranean species with contrasting leaf habits and growth form. The species included two evergreen oaks (Quercus ilex subsp. ballota (Desf.) Samp. and Q. suber L.), two deciduous oaks (Q. faginea Lam. and Q. pyrenaica Willd.) and two deciduous shrubs (Pyrus bourgaeana Decne. and Crataegus monogyna Jacq.). Our main objective was to determine if stomatal sensitivity is related to differences in leaf life span and leaf habit.
   The deciduous shrubs had the least conservative water-use characteristics, with relatively high stomatal conductance and low stomatal sensitivity to soil and atmospheric drought. As a result, Psi(pd) decreased greatly in both species during the growing season, resulting in early leaf abscission in the summer. The deciduous oaks showed intermediate water-use characteristics, having maximum stomatal conductances and CO2 assimilation rates similar to or even higher than those of the deciduous shrubs. However, they had greater stomatal sensitivity to soil drying and showed less negative Psi(pd) values than the deciduous shrubs. The evergreen oaks, and especially the species with the greatest leaf longevity, Q. ilex, exhibited the most conservative water-use behavior, having lower maximum stomatal conductances and greater sensitivity to VPD than the deciduous species. As a result, Psi(pd) decreased less during the growing season in the evergreens than in the deciduous species, which may contribute to greater leaf longevity by avoiding irreversible damage during the summer drought. However, the combination of low maximum CO2 assimilation rates and high stomatal sensitivity to drought must have a negative impact on the final carbon budget of leaves with a long life span.

AB The volatile composition (volatile phenols, phenolic aldehydes, furanic compounds, lactones, phenyl ketones, and other related compounds) of Spanish oak heartwood of Quercus robur, Quercus petraea, Quercus pyrenaica, and Quercus faginea was studied by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, in relation to the processing in barrels cooperage and in relation to the French oak of Quercus robur (Limousin) and Quercus petraea (Allier) and American oak of Quercus alba (Missouri), which are habitually used in cooperage. The volatile composition of seasoned oak woods varied according to individual trees, species, and origins, and the differences were more significant in Spanish species with respect to American species than with respect to French species. The toasting process influenced the volatile composition of wood. It led to high increases in the concentration of volatile phenols, furanic aldehydes, phenyl ketones, and other related structures, but the effect on w-lactones levels depended on species and origin. The volatile composition in Spanish oak species evolved during toasting like in French and American oak, but quantitative differences were found, especially important in American species with respect to European species.

AB We have experimentally investigated the impact of biotic factors, acting at the seed and seedling stages, on a Quercus pyrenaica forest in the Sierra Nevada mountains (SE Spain). We monitored the natural establishment of the oak for 3 years in two forest plots and two shrubland plots, by counting seedlings and juveniles. In addition, we established several experiments in these plots to examine acorn and seedling survival, while also considering the microhabitat effect on survival probability. Dispersed acorns were quickly consumed by several species of predators, particularly wild boar (Sus scrofa) and woodmouse (Apodemus sylvaticus). Less than 4% of the experimental acorns survived to produce seedlings, even when they were buried 4 cm in soil, simulating caches. No effect of microhabitat was found on predation, and thus no safe site appears to exist for Q. pyrenaica acorns in the study area. Some 98% of the 1000 experimental seedlings were killed by herbivores, notably woodmice, wild boar, and domestic and wild ungulates. Seedling Survival varied spatially, being significantly higher under shrubs (4%) than in any other microhabitat (less than 0.5%)..Both acorn and seedling survival were much lower in the shrublands than in the forests. In shrubland plots, the main agent of seedling mortality was trampling by domestic ungulates foraging in herds. This study suggests that the regeneration of Q. pyrenaica forests in Mediterranean mountains can be limited by herbivores acting at several life-history stages. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB In tree biomass estimations, it is important to consider the property of additivity,.i.e., the total tree biomass should equal the sum of the components. This work presents functions that allow estimation of the stem and crown dry weight components of Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) trees. A procedure that considers additivity of tree biomass components is presented, and applied to a particular case. The application of a simultaneous equations system estimation procedure that used parameter restrictions and considered residual contemporaneous correlations allowed more efficient estimates and consistent prediction intervals.

AB We studied gas-exchange patterns and leaf traits of seedlings and mature trees of three coexisting Mediterranean oaks with contrasting leaf habits (the evergreen Quercus ilex, and the deciduous Q. faginea and Q. pyrenaica) during the well-watered part of the growth season. Leaf life span in Q. ilex seedlings was shorter than in mature trees, whereas for the deciduous species the differences in leaf life span between both growth stages were less pronounced. In all species leaves on seedlings displayed a lower mass per unit area and lower nitrogen content than on mature trees. However, owing to their larger stomatal conductance, leaves on seedlings usually showed larger photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency and lower water-use efficiency than on mature trees. Stomatal conductance and CO2 assimilation rate were lower in Q. ilex than in the two deciduous species at the mature stage. However, the interspecific differences in gas exchange rates related to differences in leaf longevity disappeared at the seedling stage because in Q. ilex the seedlings showed a much higher stomatal conductance than the adults. Thus, seedlings of the three species showed a common strategy, regardless of the leaf life span, probably as a response to the competition from the herbaceous layer.

AB Nitrogen uptake, nitrogen demand and internal nitrogen cycling were studied to address the question of the importance of nutrient storage in Quercus species with contrasting leaf longevities. We carried out this study at the whole-plant level with young trees (2-4 years old) of three Mediterranean Quercus species: the evergreen Q. ilex, the marcescent/evergreen Q. faginea, and the deciduous Q. pyrenaica. Seasonal dynamics of nitrogen in all compartments of the plant were followed for 3 years. Nitrogen losses were measured through litter production, herbivory and fine root shedding. Nitrogen uptake was estimated using increments of nitrogen plant content plus accumulative nitrogen losses. Nitrogen uptake was limited to a few months during late winter and spring. Before budbreak, acquired nitrogen was stored in old-leaf cohorts of evergreen and woody compartments. After budbreak, Quercus species relied first on soil uptake and second on nitrogen retranslocation to supply new growth requirements. However, in most cases we found a high asynchrony between nitrogen demand by growing tissues and soil supply, which determined a strong nitrogen retranslocation up to 88.4% of the nitrogen demand throughout leaf expansion. Except for the first year after planting, the above- and underground woody fractions provided more nitrogen to the new tissues than the old leaf cohorts. Differences in the benefit of nitrogen withdrawn from senescent and old leaves were not found between species. We conclude that sink/source interaction strength was determined by differences between nitrogen demand and uptake, regulating internal nutrient cycling at the whole plant level.

AB The present work compares the results obtained with two indirect techniques (neutron probe and time domain reflectometry, TDR) for measuring soil water contents (theta) at different depths on an experimental plot in the "Sierra de Gata" (Central Western Spain). At the same time, the temporal and spatial evolution of theta was assessed in the zone studied. Measurements were made over three years (from September 1996 to August 1999). The results point to a good correlation (r = 0.98) between theta measured with both techniques, although TDR slightly (but significantly; P < 0.01) underestimated the &theta; values, but only during the drying periods and with low &theta; values. Non-significant differences between both methods were found for the estimation of soil water contents in the whole soil profile. Accordingly, both techniques are interchangeable and it is thus possible to avoid the potential risk of radioactivity. Considerable inter-annual variability was observed in the soil water content, governed by the annual rainfall distribution. A "flowing-off" effect was observed, followed by a progressive re-wetting of the soil profile from the bottom. Both the temporal and spatial variabilities of soil water content were found to decrease with depth.

AB The drippy nut disease of oak was first described in California in 1967 and, since then, the causal agent has not been reported in any other area. This study describes for the first time in Europe the isolation of Brenneria (Erwinia) quercina from bark canker in addition to drippy bud and drippy nut in Quercus ilex and Q. pyrenaica. The bark canker and drippy bud symptoms were not previously described as caused by this bacterium. No fungal pathogens were associated with any of the symptoms. Physiological and biochemical characterization identified the pathogenic isolates from Spain as belonging to B. quercina, similar to the reference strain CFBP 1266. Fatty acid profiles of the Spanish isolates also were similar to the strain of B. quercina from California. Serological analysis by indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using polyclonal antisera against the reference strain of B. quercina and one Spanish oak isolate revealed some antigenic heterogeneity between isolates of different origins. Pathogenicity tests demonstrated that the Spanish isolates were able to reproduce internal symptoms of necrosis and acorn exudation in Q. ilex and Q. pyrenaica and suggest that B. quercina may be associated, among other causes, with the oak decline syndrome affecting Spanish oak forests.

AB A study was conducted to assess the properties of a tension porous-ceramic cup soil-solution sampler and its usefulness in extracting soil solutions in selected forest soils (haplic Umbrisols) at "Sierra De Gata" Mountains, CW-Spain. The main characteristics of the sampler evaluated were hydraulic conductivity, the time required to obtain the soil-water sample, and the volume of water uptake for optimum calibration prior to analysis of the chemical composition of the soil water solution. Hydraulic conductivity values were not substantially modified during the sampling (two hydrologic cycles). The time required to obtain the samples was relatively short (mean value 2 h) and the sphere of sampling influence was small (radii ranging from 6 to 15 cm), both depending on the size of the sampler. The chemical analyses obtained after calibrating the ceramic cup sampler pointed to: a) an effect of light adsorption by the ceramic cup, involving PO43-, DOC, major and minor cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe3+, Al3+, Mn2+, and Zn2+), and SO42- and NO3- anions; b) a release of H4SiO4; and c) no clear trend for Cl-. The Cu2+ values obtained between a blank soil solution and those obtained after passage through the ceramic cup were not correlated. Relatively low pH values (the pH of these acid forest soils is 5.1-6.2) favor the adsorption of anions and DOC, the latter also increasing the exchange capacity and cation adsorption of the cup. The results point to a generalized tendency of the ceramic cup to adsorb DOC, cations and anions (with the exception of chlorides), H4SiO4, by contrast, being released.

AB Shrubland responses to experimental burning, cutting and ploughing treatments were studied over 15 years in two shrubland communities dominated by Erica australis. The treatments represent the most frequent forms of anthropogenic disturbances experienced by these communities throughout their history. The response to burning and cutting treatments is similar, and the succession process is characterised as autosuccession. The highest values for herbaceous annuals and perennials were observed in the third and fourth years. Generally, herbaceous species remain present throughout the study period, while woody taxa ones increase their cover values over time. The quantity of herbaceous species present is in inverse proportion to the quantity of woody taxa. The woody species that appear immediately after treatments are sprouting species, namely Erica australis and Arctostaphylos uva-ursi. The response to ploughing is slower, reflecting the recovery mechanism (seedlings). However, after 15 years, there are no significant differences in regeneration between treatments. The first stages of this post-ploughing succession are dominated by annual species until the fourth or fifth years, after which woody species begin to dominate and herbaceous taxa decrease considerably. Woody species with high germination values are Halimium alyssoides and Halimium umbellatum. These shrubland communities have a very high resilience to such perturbations and start regenerating rapidly, reaching the original state in about 9 years. The appearance of the climax arboreal species of the area, Quercus pyrenaica, when it comes from germination, occurs 15 years after the perturbations.

AB The aim of this study was to analyze the contribution of atmospheric input of elements to tree nutrition in an oligotrophic forest ecosystem of Quercus pyrenaica, located in a low polluted area. The work was conducted over 3 years in four permanent plots, in the "Sierra de Gata" mountains (CW Spain). To calculate total (wet and dry) atmospheric deposition, we measured element inputs via bulk precipitation (BP), throughfall (TF), stemflow (SF), and dry deposition (DD) (filter gauge method). Available soil and leaf nutrient contents were also analyzed. Aboveground tree nutrient demand was estimated from annual tree growth and nutrient concentrations in trunks, branches, and leaves.
   Atmospheric depositions were low, especially for N (5.9 kg N ha(-1) per year) and S (7 kg S ha(-1) per year), as expected in an unpolluted area. BP dominated atmospheric deposition, but DD represented an important input of nutrients, especially for N, S, P, K, Mg, and Ca (2.2, 2.2, 0.6, 3.6, 1.4, and 3.4 kg ha(-1) per year, respectively).
   Low soil contents of N, P, and exchangeable cations were related to low canopy leaching rates, or even to canopy uptakes, showing a certain degree of self-regulation. In fact, the differences in canopy exchange (CE) found between the plots were strongly correlated to leaf contents (r > 0.9, for Mn, Mg, K and P).
   Comparison of annual aboveground accumulation of nutrients with total annual atmospheric deposition showed that the deposition amount was much higher than the annual demand of the trees for Na, S, and Zn. For P, K, Mn, and Mg annual atmospheric deposition matched the annual tree demand for aboveground growth. For N and Ca, atmospheric depositions reached between 58 and 31%, respectively, of the annual demands. This contribution by atmospheric depositions would explain why these forest ecosystems have persisted in poor soils subjected to permanent and long-lasting losses of nutrients through biomass removal (i.e. leaves, timber, and grazing).

AB Knowing the beginning of the pollen season is of particular importance to people allergic to a given pollen. Phenological studies in combination with aerobiological studies enable us to observe the relationship between the reproductive phenology of the species and their airborne pollen curves. They also enable us to study the relationship between the release of pollen from anthers and its presence in the atmosphere. The objectives of this study are (1) to determine chill and heat requirements for different phenological phases in the Quercus species present in Ourense (Spain), (2) to verify the synchronization between the flowering event and the presence of Quercus pollen in the air, (3) to select the best criterion for determining the onset of the pollen season according to phenological data, and finally, (4) to obtain models enabling us to determine the onset of the pollen season. Pollen monitoring was carried out from 1993 to 2001, by means of a 7-day Lanzoni VPPS pollen trap and, in order to characterize the floral phenophase of different Quercus species, a sampling method was applied from February to June 2001. We observed that climatic and biotic factors can produce a delay in the onset of the pollen season. Temperatures above 8 degreesC and between 6 degreesC to 8 degreesC are good threshold temperatures for estimating chill and heat requirements respectively. Medium-distance transportation of Quercus robur and Quercus pyrenaica pollen from areas 10-30 km away influences the concentrations of Quercus pollen registered in Ourense.

AB Oaks that occupy Mediterranean phytoclimates share common leaf features (evergreenness, high leaf dry mass per unit area, LMA). Due to this phytoclimatic, morphological, and phenological convergence it has been suggested that they might constitute a coherent functional group. To confirm this hypothesis, some physiological parameters were determined after calculating pressure-volume curves (P-V curves) using the free-transpiration method. Seventeen Quercus species from contrasting phytoclimates were studied: six Mediterranean evergreen species (Q. agrifolia, Q. chrysolepis, Q. coccifera, Q. ilex ssp. ballota, Q. ilex ssp. ilex, and Q. suber); seven nemoral deciduous species (Q. alba, Q. laurifolia, Q. nigra, Q. petraea, Q. robur, Q. rubra and Q. velutina), and four nemoro-Mediterranean deciduous species (Q. cerris, Q. faginea, Q. frainetto, and Q. pyrenaica). Two-year-old seedlings growing under homogeneous environmental conditions (no water restrictions, uniform light, and nutrient supply) were used. The statistical analyses (correlation, mean-value comparisons, principal component analysis) of leaf features and parameters derived from the P-V curves confirmed the functional homogeneity of the three phytoclimatic groups, which were characterized by their contrasting ecophysiological response to water stress. The Mediterranean oak species developed mechanisms to avoid an excessive loss of cell water (e.g. high cell-wall rigidity). Conversely, the nemoral oaks showed the opposite. The nemoro-Mediterranean oaks per-form better than nemoral oaks under water-stress conditions, but they cannot perform as well as the Mediterranean oaks on relatively dry soils.

AB Water status and gas exchange of beech seedlings, planted in a scots pine stand (Pinus sylvestris L.) and a melojo-oak stand (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.), were monitored during two growing seasons.
   In 1996, a very dry year, minimum predawn water potential (psi(pd) +/- S.E.) of beech seedlings was, respectively, - 1.88 +/- 0.13 and -1.11 +/- 0.07 MPa under the melojo oak and pine canopies; these values revealed higher water stress in the oakwood. Also a lower osmotic potential at full turgor (Psipi(full)) was measured under this canopy (-1.61 +/- 0.1 Mpa versus -1.37 +/- 0.05 MPa in the pinewood) at the end of summer in both years. The higher osmotic adjustment that beech seedlings showed below the oak canopy was not enough to overcome the water stress they suffered at the end of summer 1996. The net photosynthesis (A)-photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) relationship reflected the acclimatization of beech seedlings to a brighter environment under the oak canopy. It brought about higher A and water vapor stomatal conductance (g,,) for a given PPFD level, but this response was only observed in dates with high water availability. Maximum values in the oak and pine stands were, respectively, 7.76 +/- 0.17 and 4.62 +/- 0.27 mumol m(-2) s(-1) for A(max) and 263 +/- 12 and 185 +/- 6 mmol m(-2) s(-1) for Differences in gas exchange between sites were more evident in 1997, as soil moisture and Psi(pd) measurements were higher than in 1996 because a more rainy summer. This fact allowed the maintenance of higher gas exchange in beech seedlings growing under oakwood linked to their higher photosynthetic capacity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the present work was to quantify the importance of the atmospheric deposition and the internal processes in soil acidification in oligotrophic Quercus pyrenaica forests, and determine the mechanism(s) involved in the neutralization of the acidity through the canopy and the soil. Four permanent oak forest plots were monitored in the Sierra de Gata mountains (Central-Western Spain): pH and mineral elements were determined in bulk precipitation, dry deposition, throughfall, stemflow, surface runoff, and in the soil, the water flowing through the humic (Ah) and mineral ( Bw) horizons. Soil acidification has been estimated from the balance of the elements (atmospheric input minus output by surface runoff and deep drainage) and the net accumulation of nutrients by biomass. The results showed that rainwater pH was 5.5, and dry deposition of H+ was lower than bulk deposition (20 vs. 31 eq H+ ha(-1) y(-1)). Throughfall was slightly less acid (pH 5.6) than the incident rain; however, stemflow was more acid than rain (pH 5.2). As a result, only 22 eq H+ ha(-1) y(-1) reached the soil surface, and the rest was taken up by the canopy (29 eq H+ ha(-)1 y(-1)), which could only explain between 4 and 8% of the cation leaching. The pH of water was increased slightly when percolating through the soil (from pH 5.6 to 5.8). Atmospheric deposition of free H+ and N-compounds had a minor contribution to the soil acidification (3 and 12%, respectively). The rest, 77% of H+, were produced by cation uptake, and 8% by mobilization of anion from mineral weathering and by precipitation or adsorption of cations. Almost all the acidity generated by the external and internal sources, was buffered by the soil (2.40 keq ha(-1) y(-1) on average), and losses from the soil were less than 1% of total H+. Neutralization occurred mainly by release of base cations from exchange surfaces and weathered minerals (71%); aluminium mobilization contributed to only 8%. If the forest reaches its degenerative phase, the lost acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) could be completely restored by release of cations during biomass mineralization. However, if biomass is exported from these forests, further acidification of these already oligotrophic oak coppices will result in the future.

AB The sulphur balance in a non-polluted forested area in western Spain was estimated. The study was carried out over a period of 3 years (1990-1993) in a semi-natural, deciduous oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd) forest, where a permanent experimental plot was selected. Sulphate concentrations and fluxes in rainfall, throughfall, surface runoff, and drainage leachates were measured. The litterfall production, the aboveground biomass, and the S concentration in these plant fractions were measured. The S demand, S uptake, and S resorption were calculated. A positive balance was found in the ecosystem studied, since total atmospheric inputs (6.0 kg ha(-1) per year). mainly through wet deposition. were higher than the outputs (4.9 kg ha(-1) per year), mainly through deep-drainage. Inputs of S to the soil were higher via throughfall (5.0 kg ha(-1) per year) than via litterfall (1.9 kg ha(-1) per year), but almost all the SO42- reaching the soil via throughfall was leached away from the root zone. Part of the tree S requirements (3.7 kg ha(-1) per year) were met by retranslocation of S from senescing leaves just prior to shedding (0.8 kg ha(-1) per year) and by canopy absorption (1.0 kg ha(-1) per year) it is supposed that the rest of the total S demands were supplied by root uptake. Both mechanisms, S retranslocation and canopy absorption, are considered to be conservative processes that lead to nutrient economy and to a tight circulation of the nutrient in the ecosystem.

AB The response of woody species to experimental burning, cutting and ploughing was studied for a period of twelve years in a shrub community in NW Spain. The treatments represent the perturbations most frequently imposed by man on these shrub communities throughout history. The response to burning is much faster than the response to cutting. The response to ploughing is slower due to the regeneration mechanism that species use: germination. In general, the dominant species, Erica australis, influences the regeneration patterns of the rest of the species, which make up the community. There is a significant increase in the cover of woody species until the fourth year, and of herbaceous species until the third year. Subsequently, Erica australis attains dominance, returning to its original spatial occupancy and cover values, removing the herbaceous species and negatively influencing the growth of woody ones like Halimium umbellatum, Halimium alyssoides and Quercus pyrenaica. Both Erica australis and Chamaespartium tridentatum regenerated by sprouting in the burnt and cut plots, and by germination in the ploughed plot. Arctostaphylos uva-ursi only recovers after burning and ploughing. Halimium alyssoides, Halimium umbellatum, Erica umbellata and Calluna vulgaris regenerate by germination in the three plots. Differences in cover values and spatial occupancy during the first years of succession tend to be eliminated twelve years after treatment and most of the species tend to recover their initial cover values. These shrubland communities have a high degree of resilience due to the strong sprouting potential of the component species.

AB A consortium of 16 laboratories have studied chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) variation in European white oaks. A common strategy for molecular screening, based on restriction analysis of four PCR-amplified cpDNA fragments, was used to allow comparison among the different laboratories. A total of 2613 oak populations (12,214 individual trees from eight species) were sampled from 37 countries, and analysed with the four fragments, They belong to eight related oak species: Quercus robur. Q. petraea, Q. pubescens, Q. frainetto, Q. faginea, Q. pyrenaica, Q. canariensis and Q, macranthera. During this,survey. 45 chloroplast variants were detected and are described together with their phylogenetic relationships, but several of these haplotypes were pooled when there were some risks of confusion across laboratories during the survey, and finally 32 remained that were mapped and used in diversity analyses. A strong phylogeographic structure is apparent from the data, where related haplotypes have broadly similar geographic distributions, In total, six cpDNA lineages are identified, which have distinct geographic distributions, mainly along a longitudinal gradient. Most haplotypes found in northern Europe are also present in the south, whereas the converse is not true, suggesting that the majority of mutations observed were generated prior to postglacial recolonisation, corroborating the conclusions of earlier studies. The description of a new western European lineage constitutes a major finding, compared to earlier phylogenetic treatments. Although the eight oak, species studied systematically share cpDNA variants when in sympatry, they partition cpDNA diversity differently, as a consequence of their different ecology and life history attributes. Regional differences in levels of differentiation also exist (either species-specific or general): these seem to be related to the intensity of past and present management of the forests across Europe but also to the level of fragmentation of the range within these regions.

AB Galician territory (NW Spain) is mostly included within the Eurosiberian Region according to its phytogeographic sectorization. Some areas of the region, located towards the coastline and the inland Spanish Meseta, are considered to belong to the Mediterranean Region.
   Short-term recovery of different shrubland communities has been studied (heaths with Pterospartum tridentatum (L.) Willk. and Erica umbellata L. and "escobonales" with Cytisus multiflorus (L'Her) Sweet. These communities are representative of serial states of Quercus robur L. and Quercus pyrenaica Willd. woodlands after fire. The aim of this paper was to establish the erosion risk related to vegetation cover and/or revegetation needs.
   This recovery has been evaluated by quantifiying the general and specific cover through space and time.
   One year after fire, some of these communities (Daboecio cantabricae - Ericetum aragonensis show equal or higher cover values than those that were established to reduce the risk of soil losses by erosion. Within the same time span other communities (Genistello tridentatae -Ericetum aragonensis, Ulici minoris-Ericetum umbellatae, Halimio alyssoidis-Cytisetum multiflori) don't reach the same cover values and this is why they have risk of soil losses by erosion.

AB The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of fire on the emergence of seedlings of six tree species and their survivability in the first phases of their life cycle. The species under study were Quercus robur, Q. pyrenaica, Pinus pinaster P. radiata, Eucalyptus globulus and Betula pendula. Seeds from the six species were heated under different thermal shocks and sown afterwards. The treatments applied were one Control and two thermal shocks (90degreesC and 110degreesC during 5min). The seeds were sown in two different areas of the same shrubland, only one of them burnt in a wild fire, on identical soil types. Six replicates of each treatment and species were scattered in each area.
   For each replicate weekly counts of seedlings were carried out over six months, calculating the average time for their emergence and studying the distribution of the seedlings emergence and mortality It was also analysed the survivability rate shown by the seedlings at the end of the first spring (5.5 months), the first autumn (10 months) and the second spring (16 months) after to be sown.
   There are highly significant differences in the emergence, survival and mortality rates among the species under study, but when the differences between the treatments are compared, they are not significant. Besides, the differences between the values of the survivability rates vary in each species depending on the time elapsed since the sowing.
   On the whole, it was verified that fire acts upon each species in a different way and that the postfire response depends rather on the innate behaviour of each species than in the intensity of fire.

AB Acid phosphatase activity (APA), labile P fractions and fine root growth were studied in an oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) forest in the Sierra de Gata, in western central Spain. Soils in the region are acid and rich in organic matter, with low levels of extractable inorganic P but with a high proportion of organic P In such soils, the activity of phosphatase enzymes is likely to be important for the control of P mineralization and P cycling and, consequently, can affect the availability of P for plant uptake. The biomass of fine roots was about 25-fold that of leaf litter, demonstrating a high allocation of C resources to the root system in order to compensate for a low availability of soil nutrients. The study compared plots fertilized with triple superphosphate (100 kg P ha(-1)) to control (unfertilized) plots. Fertilizer application had no significant effect on APA and fine root density; however, there were significant differences in available and microbial P. Spatial and seasonal variations in the APA were related to plant root density and biotic demand. Seasonal differences in the APA may also be the consequence of changes in the amount of hydrolysable organic substrates at different times of the year.

AB The indirect effect of insectivorous breeding-bird density on Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) through consumption of leaf-damaging caterpillars in a temperate deciduous forest was examined. Caterpillar abundance, caterpillar body mass and the resultant leaf damage were compared between a plot with nest-boxes and a plot without nest-boxes within the same forest. First, the installation of nestboxes led to an increase in the breeding population of insectivorous birds. Second, the present study reports experimental evidence, under natural conditions, that a high breeding-bird density depresses the numbers of free-living defoliating caterpillars. Third, caterpillars reached significantly lower body masses in the nest-box plot than in the control plot. Finally, caterpillar damage to oak leaves was significantly less in the nest-box plot compared with the control plot. Therefore, the installation of nest-boxes is an effective means of decreasing insect damage to oak leaves. These results suggest that breeding-bird predation (the third trophic level) can be important in the regulation of interactions between oak and caterpillars (the first and second trophic levels, respectively).

AB We investigated the relationship between leaf shape and leaf hydraulic resistance in a set of broadleaf Quercus tree species (Q. cerris, Q. frainetto, Q. petraea, Q. pyrenaica, Q. robur, Q. rubra, Q. velutina). Seedlings of all the studied species were grown under uniform environmental conditions. A new high-pressure flowmeter was designed to measure leaf-blade hydraulic resistance. Leaf shape was characterised by the complexity of leaf outline which was regarded as an estimate of leaf lobation. This was done using the box-counting fractal dimension of the leaf silhouette. Leaf hydraulic resistance was negatively related to leaf lobation. It is suggested that the lower hydraulic resistance in deeply lobed leaves may constitute a mechanism for improving water balance under dry atmospheric conditions.

AB The aim of this study was to examine bulk precipitation, throughfall, and stemflow in order to determine the processes involved in changes in solution chemistry throughout the canopy (wash-off of dry-deposited solutes and canopy leaching), and the amount of atmospheric deposition in an oligotrophic, deciduous forest ecosystem of Quercus pyrenaica. The work was conducted over 3 years in the 'Sierra de Gala' mountains (central-western Spain), a remote area with a low degree of anthropogenic pollution. Four permanent plots were selected following a rainfall gradient (annual mean precipitation ranges from 720 to 1580 mm per year). The results confirm the absence of acid or polluted deposition from anthropogenic sources at these sites, with a weakly acid precipitation (pH 5.4-5.6), which has a low level of solutes, specially of SO42- and NO3-. Throughfall was slightly less acid than or equally acid to the incident rain; however, stemflow was more acidic than rain, possibly because of its enrichment organic acids by leaching. Throughfall and stemflow were specially enriched in Mn, K, and P, and to a lesser extent, in Mg and dissolved organic C (DOC) from tree organs. Cation enrichment in solutions flowing through forest canopies came mainly from canopy exchange (CE), especially Mn2+, K+, and Mg2+. By contrast, inorganic anions (Cl-, NO3-, and SO42-) came from atmospheric sources (wash-off), although there was a slight CE of chloride. Part of the ammonium and nitrate from precipitation and dry deposition were absorbed by the canopy, resulting in a negative net balance. CE reflected the limited-nutrient status of the forests studied, with low CE rates and appreciable canopy absorption rates. The low acidity of the atmospheric deposition also contributed to the low CE. Depositions from bulk precipitation was higher than dry deposition (DD), as is typical of remote areas, but DD also represented an important input of nutrients to these forests, with over 30% of the total atmospheric deposition, on average. Overall, both kind of depositions could substantially contribute to the annual nutrient demand for canopy growth. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The evolution of tannins in Spanish oak heartwood of Quercus robur L., Quercus petraea Liebl., Quercus pyrenaica Wild., and Quercus faginea Lam. was studied in relation to the processing of wood in barrel cooperage. Their evolution was compared with that of French oak of Q. robur (Limousin, France) and Q. petraea (Allier, France) and American oak of Quercus alba L. (Missouri), which are habitually used in cooperage. Two stages of process were researched: the seasoning of woods during 3 years in natural conditions and toasting. Total phenol and total ellagitannin contents and optical density at 420 nm of wood extracts were determined. The ellagitannins roburins A-E, grandinin, vescalagin, and castalagin were identified and quantified by HPLC, and the molecular weight distribution of ellagitannins was calculated by GPC. During the seasoning process the different ellagitannin concentrations decreased according to the duration of this process and in the same way as those in French and American woods. The toasting process also had an important influence on the ellagitannin composition of wood. Roburins A-E, grandinin, vescalagin, and castalagin decreased during this process in the Spanish wood species, in the same proportion as in the French and American ones. Also, the seasoning and toasting processes lead to qualitative variations in the structure of ellagitannins, especially in the molecular weight distribution, as was evidenced by GPC analysis of their acetylated derivatives.

AB The evolution of law molecular weight polyphenols in Spanish oak heartwood of Quercus robur, Quercus petraea, Quercus pyrenaica, and Quereus faginea was studied by HPLC, in relation to the processing of wood in barrel cooperage. The polyphenolic composition of Spanish woods subjected to natural seasoning for 3 years and to the toasting process was studied in relation to those of French oak of Q. robur (Limousin) and Q. petraea (Allier) and American oak of Q. alba (Missouri), which are habitually used in cooperage. The concentrations of benzoic and cinnamic acids and aldehydes of Spanish woods increased during seasoning depending on the duration of this process and in the same way as those of French and American woods. The process having the main influence on the phenolic composition of wood was the toasting. It led to high increases in the concentration of phenolic aldehydes and acids, especially cinnamic aldehydes (sinapic and coniferylic aldehydes), followed by benzoic aldehydes (syringaldehyde and vanillin) and benzoic acids (syringic and vanillic acids). This polyphenolic composition in Spanish oak species evolved during toasting as in French and American oak, but quantitative differences were found, which were especially important in American species with respect to the others.

AB Leaf mass per unit area (LMA) and internal leaf anatomy often affect net gas exchange because of their effects on internal CO2 conductance to the site of carboxylation, internal shading, competition for CO2 among carboxylation sites, nitrogen concentration and its partitioning. To evaluate effects of LMA and leaf anatomy on CO2 assimilation, water-use efficiency (WUE) and nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE), we measured LMA, leaf thickness, the thickness of mesophyll components, and gas exchange rates at ambient CO2 concentration in leaves of six woody deciduous and evergreen species with different leaf life spans. In two species, CO2 assimilation was also estimated at saturating CO2 concentrations.
   There were interspecific differences in all morphological variables studied. Long-lived leaves had higher LMA and were thicker than short-lived leaves. Species with high LMA had low assimilation rates and NUE, both in ambient and saturating CO2 concentrations. Thus, in species with high LMA, assimilation was reduced by non-stomatal limitations, possibly because of a lower allocation of N to the photosynthetic machinery than in species with low LMA. Within a species, thicker leaves tended to have a lower tissue density. In intraspecific comparisons under field conditions, increasing internal air volume had positive effects on WUE, probably because of enhanced internal CO2 conductance to the site of carboxylation. We conclude that, in interspecific comparisons, different patterns of N partitioning strongly influence NUE, whereas in intraspecific comparisons, internal leaf anatomy is a key factor regulating resource-use efficiency.

AB The present work was within a general study on nutrient cycling in two forest ecosystems in the Sierra de la Demanda : a climax beech forest (Fagus sylvatica L.) and a reforested plantation of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) on land suitable for beech. The work aimed at estimating bioelement return to soil through the litterfall and throughfall with a view to defining their role in the soil and, more generally, in ecosystem bioelement dynamics.
   It was concluded that nutrient return to the soil by the litter was higher under beech compared to pine for all analyzed elements (P: 0.23-0.11 kg ha(-1) a(-1); Ca: 17.4-12.8 kg ha(-1) a(-1); Mg: 4.0-2.0 kg ha(-1) a(-1), and K: 11.5-5.7 kg ha(-1) a(-1)) except N (19.8-23.3 kg ha(-1) a(-1)). Annual differences were due to different amounts of plant organs produced, especially fruits and flowers. Approximately 64% of the water reaching the soil was accounted for by throughfall in the beech forest while in the pine stand this was 51.6%. Stemflow accounted for 6.5% in the beech forest and 0.5% in pine forest. Interception represented 30.0% and 47.9%. These values fluctuated monthly, depending on the characteristics of the rainfall.

AB Analysis of the above-ground biomass and nutrient pools in relation to soil properties and litter fall, have been performed in four Mediterranean oak forests of the Sierra de Gata Mountains, province of Salamanca, Spain, across a rainfall gradient. In order to establish biomass regression equations, the best fit was obtained by applying the allometric method Y = aX(b). Nutrient concentrations (except Ca) were highest in the leaves, although the highest percentage was stood in the trunk owing to the elevated percentage of total above-ground mass (73%). The leaves were found to accumulate a qualitatively important fraction of mobile nutrients as compared with their low percentage in total above-ground biomass (3%). The soil organic contents comply with the rainfall factor, but this does not appear to affect the complete decomposition process decisively, since the limiting factor is soil moisture. The rainfall distribution is similar for all plots studied, the main differences essentially being seen in the amount of water received during the rainy season (in each case with sufficient moisture for nutrient release). Between the plots, the main difference was seen for P, which was retranslocated to a much greater extent at Navasfrias, where the availability of this nutrient in the soil is lower. The acidity of the parent material seemed to affect the potential turnover of N, P and K. Nutrient management seems to be related to the availability for the trees of elements such as phosphorus and potassium. Nutrients present in lower amounts are recycled through the plant-soil system in much higher proportions than other nutrients present in greater amounts in the soil. The parent material mostly affects the soil content of assimilable Ca and P, on the other hand, the climate (mostly rainfall) affects the organic matter content, total N, the cation exchange capacity and the percentage of base saturation of the soil epipedons of these forest ecosystems. The plots with the lowest fertility (those located on slates) have the lowest production of litter and the lowest decay rate. Their cycles are therefore slowed down with respect to those of plots located on granites (more fertile). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water status and gas exchange of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and sessile oak [Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl.] were studied in a mixed stand in the Montejo de la Sierra forest (central Iberian Peninsula), one of the southernmost locations of both species in Europe. Gas exchange and water potential were measured in leaves at different canopy levels over several days in two growing seasons. The daily variation pattern was established with the measurements of three selected dates per year, representative of the soil moisture content situations in early, mid- and late summer. A similar daily time course of leaf water potential was found for the two species. Nevertheless, beech showed a most noticeable decrease of water potential at midmorning and maintained lower leaf water potential than oak in the early afternoon. In 1994 the sessile oak saplings showed higher values of predawn water potential (Psi(pd)) than beech at the end of summer, when soil moisture content was lowest (20 cm depth). Beech showed a significantly lower net assimilation rate (A) than sessile oak for leaves under the same PPFD. Maximum net photosynthesis values (A(max)) for beech and sessile oak on sunny leaves were 10.1+/-0.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 17.8+/-1.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) respectively, and those for water vapour stomatal conductance (g(wv)) were 26+/-31 mmol m(-2) s(-1) and 438+/-74 mmol m(-2) s(-1). Differences in A and g(wv) between the two species were maintained throughout the day on all measurement dates. No clear relationship was found between water status of saplings and stomata performance; there was only a negative correlation between Psi(pd) and g(wvmid) in beech. Nevertheless, a significant response to the air vapour pressure gradient between leaf and air was translated into stomata closure on an hourly basis, more intensively in beech.

AB The feeding habits of feral goats (Capra hircus) in relation to those of domestic and wild goats (Capra pyrenaica) were investigated. We examined food selection and year round browsing pattern in a low-density goat population, that lived as feral in the Mediterranean mountain scrubland for several generations. We compared our results with those of domestic and wild goats from the literature. Browse availability of different vegetation units was measured by visual estimation of plant species cover within 1.9 m above ground level. Also, we applied the point-centered quarter method to survey browse use. Feral goats showed a highly selective feeding behaviour which was considered as a feature that distinguished them from their domestic counterparts. Browsing use and preference of plant species by feral goats were significantly different across seasons (p < 0.05) and, in general, seasonal fluctuations of diet were consistent with the maximum nutritive value of consumed plants. Despite their high availability, plant species with strong physical or chemical antiherbivory features were avoided throughout the year. Furthermore, the relative browse use and seasonal browsing pattern of graminoids, woody spiny legumes, Rosmarinus officinalis, and Quercus ilex were similar in feral and wild goats. We concluded that the feeding habits and forage preferences of feral goats are closer to wild than domestic goats. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB In the early nineties, a case of oak decline was detected in several parts of southern Aragon (Spain). This phenomenon, locally known as "seca", has received some attention from foresters and ecologists and different explanations have been proposed: severe climatic episodes, stand ageing or fungal attacks.
   To analyse the process of oak decline in this region, two Landsat TM-5 images have been used, from 20 August 1993 and 29 September 1996. The first coincides with the period of maximal expression of the decline syndrome. The second, coinciding with an excellent vegetative period, was used as a reference because of the good recovering shown by trees during this year. The study area (400 km2) includes the whole woodlands dominated by Mediterranean and submediterranean oak species, namely Quercus ilex, Q. coccifera, Q. faginea and Q. pyrenaica. The comparison of the spectral signature values between the two images, of vegetation index (NDVI) and of green vegetation cover estimated from scaled NDVI has allowed us to confirm that a difference in the stands performance can be clearly detected, showing the critical condition reached by some woodlands during 1993. Although the NDVI values for 1996 are in average higher than in 1993, showing that oak woodland got better through this period, significant differences are found among the different species studied. The syndrome did not reach the same magnitude through the whole area, showing that the "seca" in this region must be analysed as a local phenomenon.

The calculated biomass ranged from 64 to 121 Mg ha(-1). Perennial material (trunks and branches) represented 96-97% in the four Spanish Q. pyrenaica stands and 93% in the French Q. lanuginosa and Q. ilex stands, Q. pyrenaica had higher P, Mg, Fe and Mn contents than the other two species from southern France. In contrast, these latter species had higher N and Ca concentrations. All of these differences were related to soil nutrient availability, especially Ca, Mg, P, Fe and Mn, Comparison of the chemical composition of leaves on trees with that of leaf litter indicated retention and translocation of N, P and K from leaves to perennial biomass and recycling of Ca and Mg from trees to the soil.

AB Quercus pyrenaica is a widely distributed oak species in the Iberian Peninsula which has been subjected to drastic disturbances, such as fire, leading to a significant decrease in its cover. The main objective of this study was to carry out a comparative analysis of the post-fire regeneration of two Quercus pyrenaica ecosystems. Prior to being burned by a wildfire at the end of the summer in 1985, the first ecosystem presented a developed toe layer, whereas the second one was in a shrub layer stage. In each ecosystem a permanent plot was established and sampled for a period of 6 years after the disturbance. Colonisation rate!; of different biological types were estimated, as well as the structural parameters defining the community: species diversity, richness and evenness. These results allowed us to determine a post-fire successional model for these ecosystems. Post-fire species composition of the two sites was similar, but abundance of particular species varied as a function of pre-fire abundance. ((C) Inra/Elsevier, Paris.).

AB A phytosociological study of forests with Pinus sylvestris and P. nigra subsp. salzmannii of the Spanish Sistema Central has been made, establishing a comparison with 683 coniferous communities. As a result of the application of the concepts of Kopecky & Hejny (1974), Foucault (1981), Dierschke (1993) and Kopecky et al. (1995), on the releves made following Braun-Blanquet (1964), the Vaccinio-Piceetea class and the Pinetalia sylvestris order are recognized inside the Iberian Peninsula. Moreover, the plant communities with Echinospartum barnadesii and Senecio carpetanus are interpreted as geographical races. Other aspects of the juniper communities of Junipero nanae-Cytisetum oromediterranei (subassociations, variants and relic forms) are also races. The presence of P. nigra subsp. salzmannii inside the forests of Quercus pyrenaica is considered as a thermic relic form, and the communities with P. sylvestris as altitudinal forms.

AB Quercus pyrenaica oak coppices situated in the Sierra de Gata mountains (province of Salamanca, central-western Spain). The efficiency (NUE) with which a given nutrient is used depends on several factors. In the oak coppices studied, availability of P, Ca and Mg in the soil was one of the factors governing efficiency. On the other hand, there was a certain independence between soil N and K availability and their plant efficiency; in the case of N this occurred possibly because it is a limiting factor. There was a plant nutritional Ca-Mg imbalance due to soil acidity. Leaf absorption and/or leaching at canopy level would also influence the N and K efficiency. The stand with the most dystrophic soil was the least efficient regarding Mg, and the plot with the most eutrophic soil regarding Ca. All the oak coppices had low N efficiency. Bioelement resorption did not affect the NUE decisively but it seemed to be influenced by leaf absorption and leaching occurring at the canopy level. Higher aboveground production suggested that the stands on granite absorbed greater yearly amounts of N, K and P than those on schist. ((C) Inra/Elsevier, Paris.).

AB Low molecular weight polyphenols and ellagitannins were analyzed by HPLC, and the molecular weight distribution of ellagitannins was calculated by GPC, in oak heartwood of Quercus robur L., Quercus petraea Liebl., Quercus pyrenaica Wild., and Quercus faginea Lam., grown in Spain, before and after 1 year of seasoning, in Bordeaux, France. During this process, the concentrations of low molecular weight polyphenols (acids and aldehydes, benzoic and cinnamic, and coumarins) increased, and those of ellagitannins (castalagin, vescalagin, and roburins A-E) decreased. A similar behavior for the A and B compounds in all species was not found. This modification in the chemical composition was similar in the four Spanish species of Quercus studied and allowed the differentiation between the unseasoned wood and the wood after the first year of seasoning.

ID CLUSTERS
AB Monthly precipitation and monthly mean temperature records from 255 meteorological stations in Central Spain (Spanish Sistema Central) were analyzed by cluster and principal component analyses. Classification separated 14 groups according to altitude, geographical distribution, as well as the combination of rainfall and temperature. The first cluster emerged as significantly higher and colder than the second. Then, two ordinations were carried out: one for the 14 groups extracted from the classification and a second for the total station pool. The second ordination was compared with potential natural vegetation data taken around each station. The first ordination summarized the principal climatic characteristics of the Spanish Sistema Central: its behaviour is that of a typical Mediterranean mountainous territory combining summer aridity and variation of temperature with altitude and the influence of winter winds. The ordination of all stations reflected a thermal, rainfall and summer aridity gradient. Meteorological stations situated at the highest altitude or with highest precipitation records characterized by scrub communities or pine woods and Quercus pyrenaica forests, appeared well-separated along the first two axes. Only the most thermophilous Q. rotundifolia associations could be clearly separated. The fourth axis was useful in clarifying some vegetation overlap of deciduous and sclerophyllous forests, along an east-west summer aridity gradient.

AB The potential nutrient return in a chestnut coppice (Castanea sativa Miller) over a period of 3 years (1991-1994) has been established and compared with the returns found in four deciduous oak (Quercus pyrenaica Wild.) forests (1990-1993) located in the Sierra de Gata mountains (central Spanish system). A convergence of abscission phenology patterns was observed among the different ecosystems studied,together with a delay in leaf fall at the warmest plot. This similarity is logical since the plots harbour the same deciduous species which are, however, subjected to climatological variations. The chestnut coppice was found to be more productive than the oak forests, the amounts of leaves, branches, flowers and total litterfall being significantly greater. Statistical analysis showed a highly significant correlation between the chestnut coppice and the oak forest aboveground production, ranging between 0.82 and 0.96 for the leaves and between 0.72 and 0.89 for the total litter. In general, the leaf organs of the chestnut trees showed a higher concentration of bioelements than the oaks, with N and Ca predominant in the buds, Ca and Zn in the branches, K in the fruits, and above all Fe and Cu in the other plant remains. In all the forests studied, the potential nutrient supply fluctuated over the years and depended strongly on phenological factors; above all it was found to be governed by the leaves, which contributed most to the return of mineral nutrients to the soil. The most marked potential nutrient return through the oak aerial organs occurred on the plot with the lowest rainfall, particularly with respect to P and Ca. Considering all the forest plots, the general sequence of the amount of bioelements returning with the litterfall to the soil was as follows:
   C > N > Ca > K > Mg > P > Mn > Na > Fe > Zn > Cu
   with the exception of one oak plot (with an acid soil reaction and poor soil drainage), when the Mn return was higher than that of P owing to the high concentration of Mn in all the litter components. (C) Inra/Elsevier, Paris.

AB The present work fits into a general study on nutrient cycling in four Quercus pyrenaica oak forests and one Castanea sativa chestnut coppice located in the Sierra de Gata mountains (Central System, western Spain). The work consists of an estimation of bioelement supplies to the soil by the litter of these species and by throughfall from the canopy with a view to defining their role in the soil and, more generally, in ecosystem bioelement dynamics. It is concluded that the greatest differences between the oak stands and the chestnut coppice lie in the fact that in the latter ecosystem potentially more N, P, K, Mg, Na and Mn return through the litter owing to greater production in the chestnut coppice (and/or root uptake). Additionally, the relative importance of some bioelements (N, P, K and Mn) in the chestnut coppice is different from that of the oak forests. It is also possible to differentiate three groups of bioelements: 1) those that potentially return almost exclusively through the litter (C and N); 2) those for which both litter and throughfall must be taken into account to determine the potential return of bioelements (Ca, Mg, P, K, Fe and Mn); and 3) those that return almost exclusively through canopy leaching (Na, Cu and Zn). Despite this, on attempting to calculate the actual minimum annual returns, the three groups must be reduced to two: bioelements that almost exclusively return by throughfall (Na, Cu and Zn), and bioelements that return through litter decay and canopy leaching. Exceptionally, Fe behaves in a special way in the sense that it tends to be immobilized by decaying leaf litter. (C) Inra/Elsevier, Paris.

AB The germination capacity of Quercus pyrenaica seeds subjected to different temperatures (60 degrees C, 100 degrees C and 150 degrees C for 1 and 5 minutes) and mechanical scarification was studied. Germination increased after mechanical scarification and heat treatment at 60 degrees C for 1 minute. Germination percentages for the rest of the treatments were lower than those for the control, but statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were only observed between 150 degrees C for 5 minutes and the other treatments (except for 150 degrees C for 1 minute). These results show that seed germination of Quercus pyrenaica would not be affected by soil temperatures reached during a low intensity fire or by the action of agents which can mechanically damage the external coat.

AB The dynamics of vegetation in the North Iberian Peninsula have been historically established from peaty and lacustrine records obtained in strongly continental mountainous areas. Pollen records located in areas with a more oceanic climate, have allowed a more precise evaluation of the changes and differences in the vegetation development of the various biogeographical areas in the North Iberian Peninsula, during the Late-glacial and Holocene. It was found that:
   (1) The vegetation of the Cantabrian-Atlantic province in northern Iberian Peninsula responded to climatic changes during the last 16 000 years.
   (2) Tree vegetation declined during the Oldest Dryas, with steppe vegetation in the interior and cryophilous vegetation along the coast.
   (3) During the time of the Lateglacial Interestadial, lowlands, arboreal vegetation was dominant in the landscape (Pinus, Betula, Quercus, Corylus).
   (4) During the Younger Dryas the differences between coast and interior are less obvious.
   (5) During the Holocene oceanic decidious forests of Quercus robur, Corylus avellana, Tilia sp. and Fagus sylvatica were present along the coast. At low altitudes, in the interior, forests of Quercus robur/pyrenaica, enclaves of pine woods and Mediterranean types of forest (Quercus ilex, Olea europea) were present. At higher altitudes Pinus (P. sylvestris and P. uncinata) or mixed forests of Pinus and Betula were dominant.

AB This study analyzes the role of summer habitat selection in determining the distribution of a population of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.) in central Spain, where surplus individuals have emigrated from mountains to the surrounding plateaus during the last decade. The species was more abundant in the mesic mountain forests (Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica)) than in the xeric, sclerophyllous helm oak (Quercus ilex) forests of surrounding plateaus. Roe deer prefer patches occupied by brambles (Rubus spp.) and rose bushes (Rosa spp.) and patches with higher cover on pastures and moors (Erica spp. and Calluna spp.). These vegetation types are linked to moist soils in the Mediterranean zone, indicating that roe deer prefer the moister, more productive patches. Roe deer actively selected productive patches covered by leguminous shrubs (Sarothamnus, Retama) and rejected poor patches covered by Cistus ladanifer and Cistus laurifolius (two shrubs that produce chemicals toxic to other plants). Low summer primary productivity of xeric, sclerophyllous forests can explain the low abundance of roe deer in these forests. This supports the view that habitat constraints limit numbers and distribution of this Palaearctic species at the southern edge of its range.

AB Pit-fall trap catches were used to study the recolonization by the coleoptera fauna of Quercus pyrenaica ecosystems disturbed by wildfires. Two close oakwoods in Leon province of Spain were sampled monthly in 1990, with pit-fall traps, one burnt in June 1986 and in the other August 1989. Carabid genera such as Pterostichus and Anysodactylus increased in the four years post-fire recovered area compared to the recently burnt area and the non-burnt area. The species most affected by the environmental changes were the less generalist species, that occurred less frequently than the more adaptable species.

AB Epiphytic lichens can exert some negative actions on trees, since they penetrate to different degrees into several tissues of the phytophore. Evernia prunastri (L.) Ach. hyphae progress into xylem vessels of Fagus sylvatica, Quercus pyrenaica and Betula alba. This is on the basis of a mechanism through which Lichens inject metabolic inhibitors in the xylem vessels, and, after their translocation in the xylem sap, they reach different organs of the phytophore and produce defoliation. In this report, we have noted that usnic acid is more impermeant than atranorin through the chloroplast membrane of Quercus rotundifolia leaves. On the other hand, we have also noted the degradation of chlorophyll in response to Lichen substances.

AB Succession among epiphytic bryophytes is studied in a deciduous forest of Quercus pyrenaica Willd. from the Spanish Central Range, with the objective of assessing fluctuations of species and life-forms throughout the life-span of trees. For this purpose, an indirect method is used, which consists of studying epiphytes occurring on different-aged trees. Additionally, a new index, called the "Index of Ecological Significance (IES)" and derived from a combination of relative frequency and mean cover, is used to evaluate the ecological importance of taxa in epiphytic habitats.
   Results show qualitative and quantitative changes in epiphytic community composition during the tree life-span. Young trees are colonized by pioneer species. Some of them become more extensive on older trees, while others disappear, and a group of additional species occur exclusively on old trees. Similarly, species richness and bryophytic cover increase with tree age, while community composition and structure change, due to species and life-form replacement. These changes take place in a similar way on bases and trunks, although the former are always bryofloristically richer. As for successional patterns, both bases and trunks feature a main lineal and allogenic series, which is completed by a secondary cyclic and autogenic series that is restricted to old trees.

AB The release and dynamics of macronutrients from decomposing leaf litter were determined for two deciduous oak species: one in Spain, Quercus pyrenaica, growing on a humic Cambisol (Sol brun forestier) and the other in France, Q lanuginosa, on a rendsic Leptosol (Rendzine). The same processes were studied after leaf-litter exchanges between the French stand and a Spanish stand. Nylon litter bags (1 mm(2) mesh), containing 10 g of leaves, were placed in five stands (four in Spain and one in France) and collected every 2 months when they were weighed and analysed for N, P, Ca, Mg and K. The mean amount of nutrients in the decomposing leaves decreased over the 36-month period. The four Q pyrenaica stands were classified into two groups involving different nutrient release processes, without any relation to yearly litterfall. For the Q lanuginosa stand, the results obtained were similar to those for one of the Q pyrenaica groups. Similar nutrient release processes occurred in the litter-bags collected from native stands and after exchanges between the two species, with a quick release of K, followed by Mg and P. Higher Ca accumulation was noted for the I? pyrenaica litter as compared to Q lanuginosa litter. For N, the results were very different between the two species and the two locations.

AB Seasonal variation in nutrient concentration in leaves and branches of Quercus pyrenaica was studied in natural Q. pyrenaica forest in the Sierra de Gata (Salamanca Province, Spain). Two permanent plots were established at the two extremes of a rainfall gradient in this area: annual mean precipitation from 720 mm at Fuenteguinaldo (granite bedrock) to 1580 mm at Navasfrias (schists and graywackes).
   Leaf and branch samples were collected every three weeks during the growing season from May to October, at three height levels of the tree canopy. Seasonal changes and internal nutrient dynamics were investigated for N, Ca, Mg, K, Na, Mn, Fe and P during a two-year period.
   The concentrations of all nutrients varied among the seasons; these variations were related to nutrient mobility and the annual physiological cycle. Nutrient concentrations decrease in the case of K and P, while the sparse mobile nutrients Ca, Mg, Mn and Fe gradually accumulated during each growing season. In Navasfrias a considerable resorption of P from senescing leaves was detected. Different patterns were found for the other nutrients studied (Na and N).

AB We studied the mineralogical and chemical modifications in four soils in Spain produced by a forest fire: two of the soils developed under Quercus pyrenaica and two under Juniperus oxycedrus. Samples were taken 2 and 8 months after the fire. Increases in soil pH, electrical conductivity, exchangeable-bases and total Ca occurred in both soils, but were more evident under Juniperus oxycedrus. The presence of calcite and alteration of vermiculite, were observed in soils beneath Juniperus oxycedrus, but not Quercus pyrenaica. This was due to lower temperatures reached during the fire in the mineral soil under this species. By heating plant and soils samples in the laboratory to 300, 400 and 500 degrees C, the formation of calcite during the burning of Quercus pyrenaica (500 degrees C) and Juniperus oxycedrus (300 degrees C) was confirmed. According to the chemical and mineralogical modifications observed in-vitro, the temperature in the mineral soil under Juniperus oxycedrus reached during the fire was close to 300 degrees C.

AB Climatic differences between three types of deciduous (Quercus pyrenaica) and three types of sclerophyllous (Quercus rotundifolia) Mediterranean forests in the Spanish Sistema Central were analyzed by means of Canonical Discriminant Analysis and Jancey's Discriminant Analysis, applied in successive steps to data from 252 meteorological stations. Climatic data included temperature and precipitation records as well as bioclimatic indices. Discriminant analysis was applied to broad-leaved sclerophyllous and deciduous forest communities sampled at each meteorological station using phytosociological methods. Annual and seasonal (summer, spring) water availability are the most important factor controlling the distribution of the two physiognomic forest types; southwestern associations of Quercus pyrenaica and Q. rotundifolia differ from their colder homologues by annual and monthly temperatures; western associations were separated from eastern ones in terms of annual and seasonal precipitation gradients. Discriminant analysis was a good technique to explore climatic gradients not shown by other general ordination or classification methods.

AB The effect of the canopy on leaf decomposition of beech (Fagus sylvatica) and melojo oak (Quercus pyrenaica) was studied during a period of 660 days in a mountain forest of central Spain; response of leaves to leaching was also studied to determine the effects of rainfall after leaf fall. Beech leaves lost 5.8% of their weight by leaching, whereas melojo oak leaves lost 13%. Under both types of canopy, beech leaves showed almost no difference in their decomposition patterns, with decay constants of 0.31 and 0.32 respectively. Melojo oak leaves showed quite a different behaviour under both canopies; decay constant was 0.47 under Quercus pyrenaica and 0.77 under beech canopy. Total immobilization of nitrogen was less in the melojo oak forest. Effects of summer dryness were sharper in the melojo oak forest, where decomposition stopped during the summer. This delay in the decomposition might have been due to the lower canopy density in the melojo oak forest, The decomposition patterns of the leaves of both species, under the canopy of the other species, suggests what might happen in mixed stands. Thus, the presence of melojo oaks in beech forest would increase decay and decrease nitrogen immobilization. The presence of beech trees in melojo oak forests would improve microclimatic conditions and increase decay, whereas beech litter on the soil would immobilizate more nitrogen.

ID ORGANIC-MATTER
AB A long-term (3 years) study has been made of the leaf-litter decomposition process in four forest ecosystems across a rainfall gradient. The soil organic contents comply with the factor of rainfall, but this does not appear to affect the complete decomposition process decisively, since the limiting factor is soil humidity. The rainfall distribution is similar for all the plots studied and the main differences are seen essentially in the amount of water received during the wet season (in each case with sufficient humidity for leaf decomposition to progress). Thus, leaf-litter decay is linked to the maintenance of soil humidity, mineralization slowing down when the soil dries out, and the effects of climate therefore predominating over the chemical characteristics of the material in the regulation of the decomposition process (at least at short term). In this sense, the summer drought is the most unfavourable environmental factor in this type of climate. Ln advanced stages of decay the rate of weight loss becomes relatively independent of climate. The decomposition rates obtained by the litterbag procedure are lower than those calculated by litter production and permanent litter; the reason for these differences is probably the limitation of the mesofaune activity in the litterbags. Leaf decomposition constants ranged from 0.33 on the plot with the highest rainfall to 0.47 (on the driest plot), corre sponding to mean residence times of 2.0 to 1.1 years, respectively. However, each bioelement has a different residence time.

AB Water relations were monitored in a natural mixed stand of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl.) and melojo oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) during a growing season. Soil moisture content and air temperature were recorded in an especially dry year with rainfall under 15 mm for 3 months during the middle of the growing season. Leaf samples of the three species were periodically taken at dawn and pressure-volume curves were performed with the transpirational method. Osmotic potentials, relative water content at turgor loss point, maximum bulk modulus of tissue elasticity and the dry weight/turgor weight ratio were obtained for the curves.
   Differences for osmotic potential at full turgor and at turgor loss point were significant between dates while considering the species altogether, with minimum values on 6 September, matching with the minimum soil moisture. Osmotic potential at full turgor decreases as soil drought increases, the extreme mean values (-1.32 MPa in spring and -2.31 MPa in summer) being reached by the melojo oak. Osmotic potential at turgor loss point follows a similar pattern of variation to the one at full turgor. Melojo oak and beech also show significant differences for the whole period.
   No apparent pattern is associated with relative water content at the turgor loss point and maximum bulk modulus of tissue elasticity, although there were significant differences for the growing season as a whole. The three species ranked according to decreasing values of the relative water content at the turgor loss point, in parallel to their increasing xerophytic character throughout the growing season. Beech has the highest value (87.22%) and melojo oak the lowest one (83.52%), sessile oak having an intermediate value (85.94%).
   The capacity of adaptation for living together may explain why the expected differences in the parameters between species and dates are not always significant. However, the data highlight the higher xerophytic condition of melojo oak and the more mesophytic character of beech despite the relict condition of the stand.

AB Quercus pyrenaica natural forests located in the Sierra de Gata (Salamanca Province, Spain) were studied. Two permanent sampling sites were selected at the two extremes of a rainfall gradient in this area. Diurnal courses of transpiration rate, stomatal conductance and leaf water potential were determined approximately every 2-3 weeks in 1991 and 1992 during the active leaf period at different levels in the tree canopy. Current variations in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) incident to the leaf surface, air and leaf temperature, vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and soil moisture were also measured. Boundary-line response curves between leaf conductance and four variables were studied to determine the general stomatal response patterns. Leaf conductance increased rapidly at first, with small increases in PAR. Above 50 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), no additional increases in conductance were observed. The optimum temperature ranged between 18 and 22 degrees C. Conductance remained constant at low and moderate VPD values and strongly decreased after a given threshold value (2.4 KPa). The response was sharper at the humid site. Beyond a threshold leaf water potential level (-2 MPa), stomatal conductance decreased rapidly as water potential continued to decline.

AB Water and several bioelement balances were established for four Quercus pyrenaica forests along a pronounced pluviometric gradient, located in the Sierra de Gata mountains (central Spain), to obtain information on the effect of rainfall on annual and summer evapotranspiration, on nutrient leaching from the soils and on the evolution of fertility. There was a positive correlation between the annual evapotranspiration and the precipitation in the May-August period, but not with annual precipitation. From all water fluxes within the ecosystems, deep drainage represented the most important difference between plots. An excess of water in the soil is produced in winter, resulting in nutrient leaching of the soil and a consequent loss of fertility, which becomes greater as the pluviometry gradient increases. This was confirmed by the net balance of several bioelements, the Cation Denudation Rate, the Ca/Al ratio and pH of the soil solution and canopy leaching values.

AB There are nine species of oaks in French forests: Quercus petraea, Q robur, Q pubescens, Q pyrenaica, Q ilex, Q rubra, Q suber, Q coccifera and Q cerris. Among them, five are of major economic and ecological importance, either because of the quality and value of their wood or because of their geographic extension, or both. Two of these species are widespread in the hills and plains of the Atlantic and of the mid-European domains: Q petraea (sessile oak), and Q robur (pedunculate oak). Four are present in the Mediterranean region: Q pubescens (pubescent oak), Q ilex (helm oak), Q suber (cork oak) and Q coccifera (kermes oak). Pubescent oak is also present in the Atlantic and mid-European regions provided the local soil and climate conditions are favorable. The last species is of very limited extent and will not be considered further in this review. First, we will analyze the distributions of these species in France, as they result from the vegetation dynamics in Europe and the long-lasting action of man. Second, their synecology will be described, based on the empirical knowledge accumulated by botanists and phytoecologists. We will then describe the vegetation series to which they are related. We will next consider the results of ecophysiologal studies of the species, carried out in many laboratories in France and in other European countries. Finally, we will review the sylvicultural practices applied to oak forests, their productivity under different local conditions and the diverse products they yield.

ID BALANCE; DROUGHT; PATTERN; SUMMER; MODEL
AB A study was made to examine the temporal dynamics of water in four oak forests (Quercus pyrenaica) situated across a rainfall gradient. A simple model of monthly water balance was used, calculated from the time course evolution of soil water storage measured with a neutron, moisture gauge and the relationship between deep drainage and soil water content. The results showed that precipitation was significantly related to drainage but not to actual evapotranspiration. Rainfall interception was moderate, and surface runoff negligible (14% and <0.5% of the rainfall, respectively). The dynamics of the soil water revealed two periods: wet and dry. In the first it was observed that the greater the rainfall, the greater the drainage of the soil profile, without involving a significant change in the water availability for plants. In the second moderate to low transpiration values were obtained, meaning an important limitation in the consumption of water for plants and/or the need for extracting water from the weathered and/or fissured bedrock.

ID FIRES
AB Changes in the chemical characteristics of soil and postfire plant succession were studied in eight oak (Quercus pyrenaica) ecosystems in the Province of Leon (NW Spain) during the first 3 years following the pre. An increase in organic matter, C/N ratio, available K, and P resulting from the fire was observed. It was also observed that with time, these parameters tended to decrease. However, there is a great differ difference in values in sites with the same regeneration age (e.g., 925-975 kg ha(-1) of available K 1 month following the fire, but 225-935 kg ha(-1) 2 years following the fire). It was therefore appropriate to compare the values for each site in successive years. A study into the relationship between vegetation and the edaphic conditions by canonical correspondence analysis shows the importance of initial conditions, given that the regeneration process is an autosuccession.

AB We compared the flowering and fruiting phenology of Symphytum tuberosum L. (Boraginaceae), Hyacinthoides non-scripta (L.) Chouard (Liliaceae) and Melittis melissophyllum L. (Labiatae) in a beech wood and an oak wood situated in the same valley, taking into account their different microclimatic and edaphic characteristics and carrying out correlation and simple regression analyses. Differences observed in the phenological cycles of the species studied included earlier flowering and longer cycles in the oak wood, except for H. non-scripta. The most important climatic factors were soil moisture and the relative humidity, followed by temperature and the number of daylight hours and photosynthetically active radiation (P.A.R.). The M. melissophyllum cycle depended mainly on water availability, H. non-scripta on solar radiation, soil moisture and a temperature threshold value, while no specific climatic parameter was found to affect S. tuberosum. Temperature was found to be less important than previously believed as it seems only to correlate with S. tuberosum flowering. The strong correlation observed in the fruiting of the three species indicated clear synchronization.

AB The dynamics of bioelements lost during leaf litter decomposition were experimentally determined in three forest ecosystems located in a semiarid zone of the Duero Basin, Province of Zamora, Spain, during 2 years. The three ecosystems were a climax Quercus rotundifolia (evergreen oak) woodland, a paraclimax Pinus pinea (stone pine) forest, and a disclimax P. pinaster (maritime pine) forest. The total content of bioelements found in the litter was low in relation to other forest ecosystems: 27, 14, and 8 kg N ha(-1) in Q. pyrenaica, P. pinea, and P. pinaster, respectively; 17, 10, and 9 kg Ca ha(-1), respectively; about 2 kg P ha(-1), 4 kg K ha(-1), and 5 kg Mg ha(-1) in the three forests. The Q. rotundifolia woodland potentially returns a greater amount of N and Ca than both Pinus forests. An in situ litter bag method was used for the determination of dynamics of the decomposing leaves. A progressive loss of C, P, and Mg in the decomposing oak leaves and pine needles, and a sharp loss of K were observed; by comparison, a tendency to maintain N and Ca was seen. Pinus pinaster forest had the lowest annual N and P return.

AB Nutrient ion concentrations in soil water were assessed in three deciduous forests in the Sierra de Gata Mountains, central-western Spain, with annual precipitation ranging between 720 and 1,580 mm. Soil solutions were obtained at incremental depths from 15 to 110 cm with tension lysimeters and analyzed for pH, electrolytic conductivity (EC), dissolved organic carbon, soluble Si and Al components, Fe3+, Cu2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-, and NO3-. In general, ion concentrations and pH decreased with depth (from pH 6.5 to 5.5) and EC from 50 to 25 mu S cm(-1). At the driest forest site (Fuenteguinaldo), the highest EC values were at the profile surface, probably due to a lower degree of leaching and increased capillary action, as compared with profiles from forests with a higher annual precipitation. Soil water content was correlated with soil solution composition, showing a strong interdependence. The ionic composition of soil water in the three Cambisols, however, did not reflect the differences of annual precipitation.

AB A comparison was made of certain elements of the biogeochemical cycle of soils in forest ecosystems of the deciduous species Quercus pyrenaica (Willd.). Four sampling sites were selected in a rainfall gradient, with slight differences in the understory composition. Two of the sires were over schist and the other two over granites; however, the soil type (xerumbrepts),vas similar for the four sites. Soil chemical and physicochemical parameters such as carbon, nitrogen, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and exchangeable cations were monitored in the upper soil horizon (0-10 cm). Samples were collected every 3 months for 3 years. The final sample size was n=96. An lnverse relationship between rainfall and exchangeable cation concentration was found, with significant differences (p <.05) among the sites, with the exception of exchangeable sodium. The sum of cation values were 8.15 cmol kg(-1) for site 1 (720 mm mean annual precipitation), 3.07 cmol kg(-1) for site 2 (872 mm mean annual precipitation), 2.02 cmol kg(-1) for site 3 (1245 mm mean annual precipitation), and 1.96 cmol kg(-1) for site 4 (1580 mm mean annual precipitation). On the other hand, soil carbon, nitrogen, and CEC showed a less clear relationship to the precipitation. Litterfall and aboveground characteristics were more decisive than rainfall in determining their values.

The soils were analyzed for available Ca, Mg, P, K, total N, organic C, and pH. The principal component analysis, including the magnitudes and rates of increases or decreases of the chemical components, showed that the postfire soils of the two ecosystems had a markedly different behavior. The reasons for the differences were ascribed primarily to the intensity of the fire, caused by different understory vegetation and climatic situations.

AB Potential and actual minimum returns of bioelements were estimated in four oak (Quercus pyrenaica) forests of the Sierra de Gata Mountains, Province of Salamanca, Spain, during two annual cycles. Leaves were the principal pool of potential bioelement return, accounting for approximately 80% of return in Navasfrias and Villasrubias forests, and 70% in El Payo and Fuenteguinaldo forests. The greatest potential return of bioelements occurred in Fuenteguinaldo, especially N and Ca (53 and 32 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). The acidity of parent material seemed to affect the turnover of N, P, and K. The greater actual returns of N were found in Fuenteguinaldo (11.7 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)), favored by a lower acidity of soil (pH = 5.4), and the losses of K were higher in the granite-based soils (3.50 in the El Pave and 3.45 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in the Fuenteguinaldo plots) due ro an apparently greater plant assimilation of K. Granitic soils, above all at Fuenteguinaldo, were better nutrient balanced than the soils on schists, but the annual rainfall had a pronounced impact on C and N soil content and related parameters.

AB Soil samples from burnt and unburnt sites dominated by Quercus pyrenaica Willd. forests in Leon province (NW Spain) were collected, separated into an upper layer (0-2 cm depth) from a lower layer (2-5 cm), put in a greenhouse, and seeds allowed to germinate.
   A total of 670 identified seedlings comprising 56 species and belonging to 24 families were recorded. Most seedling were herbaceous perennials (hemicryptophytes: 59%), followed by annuals (therophytes: 23%). Many species that germinated from buried seeds were not observed as plants at any site, and came from exogenous communities. The principal means of seed dissemination were anemochory (45%) and autochory (23%).
   The number of species as well as seedlings was not significantly different between soils from the burnt and unburnt sites, but seedlings were more numerous in samples from the unburnt sites, as the number of seedlings was always highest in the upper soil layer. Germination behaviour of four particular species was characterized.
   Seedlings from the seed bank temporarily were found in the early stages of recovery of the burnt Quercus pyrenaica forests.

AB We studied the production and decomposition of litter and the return of nutrient elements to the soil in three forest ecosystems in the ''Sierra de Bejar'' mountains. Three plots representative of these ecosystems with similar soil characteristics were studied: a climax Quercus pyrenaica forest, a paraclimax Castanea sativa grove, and a replanted Pinus sylvestris forest.
   To collect litters, ten boxes were placed at random in each of the plots. The plant material was later sorted and chemically analysed.
   To study the litter decomposition, 2 cm mesh litter bags, containing 50 g of air-dried litter, were buried in the respective forest plots; random litter bags were collected at approximately two-month intervals over a period of three years.
   Mean aboveground total litter and leaf litter production of the trees are highest in the pine forest and lowest in the oak forest, but leaf/needle production is similar (about 3.5 Mg.ha(-1).yr(-1)) in the three ecosystems.
   Jenny's decomposition index is highest in the chestnut grove (0.22) and lowest in the pine forest (0.13); so, a correspondingly higher loss of organic material (36%) is observed in the decomposing chestnut leaves compared to that of pine needles (30%). However, the release of nutrient elements from the litter does not relate to decomposition rate. Only in chestnut litter was a net release of nutrients found, so the annual N, P, K, Ca, etc. requirements of trees must be mainly obtained from other soil sources, e.g. decomposing roots and mineralisation from humus layers.

Higher decomposition rates and higher Jenny's decomposition indices were observed in the chesnut leaves than in the oak and pine leaves. Under almost identical climatic conditions, chesnut leaves decomposed faster than those of oak and Scots pine. Thus, litter accumulation was highest in the pine forest, followed by the oak and chestnut forests.

ID VEGETATION
AB Epiphytic vegetation in Mediterranean deciduous woods of Quercus pyrenaica Willd. is characterized by the occurrence of a high number of facultatively epiphytic bryophytes, many of them not or rarely found on bark in other climatic areas. Based on local occurrence on different substrata, bryophyte species are grouped for their affinity for bark, and the vertical distribution of these groups is qualitatively analyzed in order to describe the ecological behaviour of bryophyte species in relation to epiphytic habitats and ecological conditions of the different tree levels. The lower tree base (0-50 cm) has the greatest bryophyte richness, and is the tree zone with the highest number of strict epiphytes, although these represent sent a small percentage in relation to the facultative ones. Reasons for this richness may be the relative attenuation of the hydric stress and the existence of a high humidity microgradient in the lower zones of the tree base (first 50 cm). The upper base (50-100 cm) is floristically similar to the trunk (100-300 cm), and both zones show a predominance of strict epiphytes and cortico-saxicolous species (including preferentially saxicolous ones, such as Grimmia spp. and Hedwigia ciliata). In these Mediterranean oak woods, ecological conditions of these two strata are likely similar to those of siliceous sunny rocks of the same area. The highest tree zones (>300 cm, crown s.l.) are dominated by strict epiphytes and cortico-saxicolous preferentially corticolous species, and form the most restrictive and xeric habitats.

DE CANOPY; OAK; TRANSPIRATION; WATER USE EFFICIENCY
AB Two permanent sampling sites were selected at the two extremes of a rainfall gradient in natural forests of Quercus pyrenaica Willd. located in the Sierra de Gata (Salamanca Province, Spain). During 1991 and 1992, diurnal courses of transpiration rate (E), stomatal conductance (g(s)) and leaf water potential (PSI1) were studied at different levels in the tree canopy.
   Leaf water potential fell from a high value in the early morning to a minimum at midday and then increased again in the afternoon. Values of PSI1 in the early morning and at midday were lower at Fuenteguinaldo (dry site) than at Navasfrias (wet site) and were related to soil water availability. Stomatal conductance increased during the morning and maximum g(s) occurred about 3 h before PSI1 was at its lowest value. The highest values of g(s) were found at Navasfrias during July.
   The lowest PSI1 values were found in the upper parts of the canopy and differences among canopy levels were greatest when soil water availability was low. In August, minimum values of Ti differed among canopy levels by 1.0 MPa at Navasfrias and by 0.8 MPa at Fuenteguinaldo. The maximum difference in g(s) among canopy levels was about 150 mmol m-2 s-1 at Navasfrias and about 300 mmol m-2 s-1 at Fuenteguinaldo. The results indicate a nonconservative pattern of water use in Quercus pyrenaica.

AB Chloroplast DNA polymorphisms have been detected by the conventional Southern-blotting hybridization method in four species of European oaks (Quercus petraea, Q. robur, Q. pubescens and Q. pyrenaica). Three polymorphisms, shared by at least three of these species, can be scored directly in ethidium bromide-stained gels and were used in a broad survey of the level of differentiation of the oak species and of their pattern of genetic structure in western Europe. The highly significant geographic variation and the high genetic differentiation (Gst = 0.895, S(Gst) = 0.025) indicate a low level of cytoplasmic gene flow. We conclude that cytoplasmic genomes are well suited for the reconstruction of past migrational routes of such a complex of species.

AB Nitrogen retranslocation from senescing leaves represents a crucial adaptation by tree species towards a more efficient use of this nutrient. As a result, this part of the nitrogen cycle has received increasing attention in recent years. However, there remain strong discrepancies with respect to the factors responsible for interspecific differences in the efficiency of this process.
   In the present work the seasonal pattern of leaf growth and the movement of nitrogen in leaves have been studied in a series of Quercus ilex plots with different levels of rainfall ard soil quality in central-western Spain, as well as in 20 other woody species typical of this area. The percentage of nitrogen retranslocated was estimated from the difference between the maximum mass of nitrogen stored in the leaf biomass and the amount of this nutrient returned annually to the soil through leaf fall.
   Q. ilex appears as one of the least efficient species in the Mediterranean region in the recovery of nitrogen from senescing leaves (29.7% of the maximum pool). Furthermore, the older leaves of Q. ilex do not show the cycles of nitrogen withdrawal during new flushes of shoot growth, such as occurs in Pinus spp. This suggests that older leaves in Q. ilex do not play an important role as nitrogen storage organs.

ID RESOURCE-EXTRACTION INDUSTRIES; AVAILABILITY DATA; GRIZZLY BEARS; ROADS
AB A study of brown bear (Ursus arctos L.) habitat relationships was conducted in the Cantabrian Mountains (northern Spain) in 1985-1988. Location data from one radiomarked bear and sign from other non-marked bears in the same geographic area were analyzed. The relation between utilization and availability of habitat features using six variables were compared by testing the null hypothesis, i.e., bears use habitats in proportion to their availability. We found no significant difference between the habitat use of the radiomarked bear and other bears in the study area. Bears preferred forested habitats and used beech (Fagus sylvatica) and durmast (Quercus petraea)/pyrenean (Q. pyrenaica) oak forests in greater proportion than their availability. All bears utilized slope aspects randomly. Bears selected areas lower in elevation than expected by chance but above the mean village elevation. Bears were located in areas further from villages and roadways than expected and used areas of moderate physiographic relief. Brown bears used the available habitats in a selective manner. The most critical area for bears was a multi-community complex of deciduous forest/shrub/grassland between 1,100-1,400 m, situated above areas of intense agricultural activity but below the subalpine zone. It is recommended that resource managers protect the important bear habitats and cover types, and manage resource exploitation and human activity so as to minimize disturbances and alterations within the bears range.
